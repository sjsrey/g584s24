Groups are selected from a set of non-overlapping complex polygons, typically in the order of thousands, while the input is a large-scale dataset that contains hundreds of millions or even billions of spatial points. Given a set of spatial points and a set of polygons, the spatial group-by query returns the number of points that lie within boundaries of each polygon. This problem is challenging because real polygons (like counties, cities, postal codes, voting regions, etc.) are described by very complex boundaries. We propose a highly-parallelized query processing framework to efficiently compute the spatial group-by query. Our experimental evaluation with real data and queries has shown significant superiority over all existing techniques.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of Bayesian hierarchical spatial models has become widespread in disease mapping and ecologic studies of health{\textendash}environment associations. In this type of study, the data are typically aggregated over an extensive time period, thus neglecting the time dimension. The output of purely spatial disease mapping studies is therefore the average spatial pattern of risk over the period analyzed, but the results do not inform about, for example, whether a high average risk was sustained over time or changed over time. OBJECTIVE: We investigated how including the time dimension in disease-mapping models strengthens the epidemiologic interpretation of the overall pattern of risk. METHODS: We discuss a class of Bayesian hierarchical models that simultaneously characterize and estimate the stable spatial and temporal patterns as well as departures from these stable components. We show how useful rules for classifying areas as stable can be constructed based on the posterior distribution of the space{\textendash}time interactions. We carry out a simulation study to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the decision rules we propose, and we illustrate our approach in a case study of congenital anomalies in England. RESULTS: Our results confirm that extending hierarchical disease-mapping models to models that simultaneously consider space and time leads to a number of benefits in terms of interpretation and potential for detection of localized excesses.},

DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Data come from the 2012 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services. STUDY DESIGN/DATA COLLECTION: We used local measures of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) analysis to identify (1) clusters of counties with higher and lower than average rates of opioid use disorders and (2) clusters of counties with higher and lower than average treatment admissions among OTPs that accept Medicaid, adjusting for county population size. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our results reveal several clusters of counties with higher than average rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) and lower than average treatment admissions among OTPs that accept Medicaid. These clusters are highly concentrated in the Southeast region of the country and include Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid enrollees in areas in the Southeast have the largest gaps between county-level OUD rates and estimated county-level capacity for treatment, as measured by county-level total treatment admissions among OTPs that accept Medicaid. Policy makers should consider strategies to increase the availability of OTPs with the capacity to serve Medicaid enrollees.},

  abstract = {Social network analysis offers powerful ways to investigate personal relationships, however, to date little work has explored the more routinized, impersonal work processes present in bureaucratic organizations. Asking whether network analysis has insights to offer into routine work, this paper investigates a data set of direct observations of diagnostic care processes in ten outpatient clinics of two different hospitals. Instead of networks of agents, this study constructs so called action networks, tying together sequences of tasks into networks structures. Following the strong social networks tradition of considering contexts, this paper examines the architectural layout of a setting as key variable. Drawing in particular on ecological approaches to the study of networks by focusing on variability, it is hypothesized that the spatial configuration of clinics is associated with performativity, i.e., a more varied set of sequences to emerge within more open-plan layouts. Results indicate that this is the case, showing how different sets of routines emerge in different types of layout depending on their spatial openness. Variability in routinization is also found between doctors, nurses and clerks, highlighting ecological niches. Network density as well as edge-weighted centralization turned out to be useful metrics for performativity. The work presented contributes to the study of bureaucratic organizations, making a case that social network methods can be fruitfully applied to impersonal, routinized and rule-driven relations. Contextual factors influencing population health have received substantial attention, especially with regard to people's social networks and the roles of built environments in their activity spaces. Yet little health research has considered spatial and social contexts simultaneously, often because of a lack of existing data. This paper presents a tool for collecting relational data on social network and activity space that extends an existing map-based questionnaire with the addition of a name generator. We then illustrate how network analysis provides a useful framework for studying connections between social and spatial contexts using data collected in the Contrasted Urban settings for Healthy Aging research project. For a long time, geographic regions were considered the dominant spatial arbiter of international migration of people. However, since the late 1970s, many scholars have argued that movements reach beyond contiguous regions to connect distant, dispersed, and previously disconnected countries across the globe. The precise structure of world migration, however, remains an open question. We apply network analysis that incorporates spatial information to international migration-stock data to examine what multilateral structures of world migration have emerged from the interplay of regional concentration (local cohesion) and global interconnectedness (global cohesion) for the period 1960{\textendash}2000. In the world migration network (WMN), nodes represent countries located in geographic space, and edges represent migrants from an origin country who live in a destination country during each decade. We characterize the large-scale structure and evolution of the WMN by algorithmically detecting international migration communities (i.e., sets of countries that are densely connected via migration) using a generalized modularity function for spatial, temporal, and directed networks. Our findings for the whole network suggest that movements in the WMN deviate significantly from the regional boundaries of the world and that international migration communities have become globally interconnected over time. However, we observe a strong variability in the distribution of strengths, neighborhood overlaps, and lengths of migration edges in the WMN. This manifests as three types of communities: global, local, and glocal. We find that long-distance movements in global communities bridge multiple non-contiguous countries, whereas local (and, to a lesser extent, glocal) communities remain trapped in contiguous geographic regions (or neighboring regions) for almost the whole period, contributing to a spatially fragmented WMN. Our findings demonstrate that world migration is neither regionally concentrated nor globally interconnected, but instead exhibits a heterogeneous connectivity pattern that channels unequal migration opportunities across the world.},

Following the format of a traditional research report we describe and discuss how to enrich research reports utilizing various types of analytical tools, data, and web services in a published paper embedded in evolving scientific discourse. We also consider how the live papers would influence the practice, culture, and economy of academic research. We conclude that geospatial researchers have an opportunity to lead this development towards richer and more open ways of communicating our findings.

The current study examines this issue by identifying which neighborhood characteristics influence educational achievement and what mechanisms mediate these associations. Using the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 linked to 1990 census information at the neighborhood level, the current studyfinds not only that neighborhood characteristics predict educational outcomes but also that the strength of the predictions often rivals that associated with more commonly cited family- and school-related factors. When considering how neighborhood characteristics influence educational outcomes, theorists have proposed several mediating processes, including collective socialization, social control, social capital, perception of opportunity, and institutional characteristics. The current study reveals that these mediators account for about 40\% of the neighborhood effect on educational achievement, with collective socialization having the strongest influence. Also discussed are the theoretical and policy implications of this study and directions for future research.},

Producers are privileged to have limitless access to market perception from consumer comments on social media and microblogs. Targeted advertising can be made more effective based on user profile information such as demography, interests and location. While these applications have proven beneficial, the ability to effectively infer the location of Twitter users has even more immense value. However, accurately identifying where a message originated from or author's location remains a challenge thus essentially driving research in that regard. In this paper, we survey a range of techniques applied to infer the location of Twitter users from inception to state-of-the-art. We find significant improvements over time in the granularity levels and better accuracy with results driven by refinements to algorithms and inclusion of more spatial features.},

Manifest Destiny, the Gold Rush, and settler colonial society drew maps, displaced Indigenous People, and reshaped the land, but they did not make California.

We Are the Land is the first and most comprehensive text of its kind, centering the long history of California around the lives and legacies of the Indigenous people who shaped it. Beginning with the ethnogenesis of California Indians, We Are the Land recounts the centrality of the Native presence from before European colonization through statehood-paying particularly close attention to the persistence and activism of California Indians in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The book deftly contextualizes the first encounters with Europeans, Spanish Missions, Mexican secularization, the devastation of the Gold Rush and statehood, genocide, efforts to reclaim land, and the organization and activism for sovereignty that built today's casino economy. A text designed to fill the glaring need for an accessible overview of California Indian history, We Are the Land will be a core resource in a variety of classroom settings, as well as for casual readers and policy-makers interested in a history that centers the native experience"--},

Based on this condition, a mathematical solution for this problem is developed and several proofs and an algorithmic approach are introduced. The algorithm is successfully implemented on many Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian graphs. This provides a new effective approach to solve a problem that is fundamental in graph theory and can influence the manner in which the existing applications are used and improved.},

The study finds current levels of sorting in the English secondary school system-defined as pupils who do not attend their proximity allocation school-to be around 50 per cent, but estimates that only one-in-five pupils are potentially active in sorting between non-faith comprehensive schools. School segregation is almost always lower in the proximity counterfactual than in the actual data, confirming that where pupils are sorting themselves into a non-proximity school, it does tend to increase social and ability segregation. The difference between school and residential segregation is greatest in urban areas and LEAs with many pupils in grammar and voluntary-aided schools.},

It is now well understood that this measure also reflects randomness in the allocation of individuals to units (i.e. it measures deviations from evenness, not deviations from randomness). This leads to potentially large values of the segregation index when unit sizes and/or minority proportions are small, even if there is no underlying systematic segregation. Our response to this is to produce adjustments to the index, based on an underlying statistical model. We specify the assignment problem in a very general way, with differences in conditional assignment probabilities underlying the resulting segregation. From this, we derive a likelihood ratio test for the presence of any systematic segregation, and bias adjustments to the dissimilarity index. We further develop the asymptotic distribution theory for testing hypotheses concerning the magnitude of the segregation index and show that the use of bootstrap methods can improve the size and power properties of test procedures considerably. We illustrate these methods by comparing dissimilarity indices across school districts in England to measure social segregation.},

This transition comes with great benefits but also significant challenges that are likely to affect those who carry out the research, usually early career researchers (ECRs). Here, we describe key benefits, including reputational gains, increased chances of publication, and a broader increase in the reliability of research. The increased chances of publication are supported by exploratory analyses indicating null findings are substantially more likely to be published via open registered reports in comparison to more conventional methods. These benefits are balanced by challenges that we have encountered and that involve increased costs in terms of flexibility, time, and issues with the current incentive structure, all of which seem to affect ECRs acutely. Although there are major obstacles to the early adoption of open science, overall open science practices should benefit both the ECR and improve the quality of research. We review 3 benefits and 3 challenges and provide suggestions from the perspective of ECRs for moving towards open science practices, which we believe scientists and institutions at all levels would do well to consider.},

  abstract = {Regionalization is the process of grouping a collection of spatial areas into spatially contiguous regions. This paper presents a novel spatial regionalization problem, termed SIRC (Scalable Statistical Inference for Spatial Regionalization with Cardinality Constraints), which involves organizing a set of spatial areas into a specific number of regions (i.e., p regions), with each region having a predefined cardinality. The primary motivation behind SIRC is to enable users to conduct statistical inference on any existing regionalization scheme by generating sample solutions that serve as a reference distribution. To address SIRC, we introduce a parallel technique named PRRP (P-Regionalization through Recursive Partitioning). PRRP recursively divides input areas into two parts: (1) one region with a predefined cardinality, and (2) the remaining unassigned input areas. This recursive partitioning is executed over three phases: the region growing phase constructs initial regions with a predefined cardinality, while the region merging and region splitting phases ensure the spatial contiguity of input areas, allowing subsequent regions to grow and achieve their predefined size. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of PRRP in solving SIRC using several real-world datasets.},

One major limitation of the MP-regions is that it does not scale well with large datasets due to its sequential design for processing the data. In this paper, we propose a parallel approximate technique called SMPP to speed up the existing MP-regions algorithm. The proposed technique introduces a low-overhead spatial partitioning technique to enable processing the data in parallel and provide substantial scalability and efficiency. The experimental evaluation compares the performance of the proposed technique against a baseline implementation. The results show that our proposed technique reduces the overall run time of MP-regions while maintaining high quality solutions.},

  abstract = {Each year, disasters such as storms, floods, fires, volcanoes, earthquakes, and epidemics cause thousands of casualties and tremendous damage to property around the world, displacing tens of thousands of people from their homes and destroying their livelihoods. The majority of these casualties and property loss could be prevented if better information were available regarding the onset and course of such disasters. Several remote sensing technologies, such as meteorological and Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, and satellite-based positioning, supported by geoinformation technologies, offer the potential to contribute to improved prediction and monitoring of potential hazards, risk mitigation, and disaster management which, in turn, would lead to sharp reductions in losses to life and property. This book explores most of the scientific issues related to spatially supported disaster management and its integration with geographical information system technologies in different disaster examples and scales. Dealing with disasters over space and time represents a long-lasting theme, now approached by means of innovative techniques and modelling approaches. Several priorities for actions are outlined toward preventing new and reduce existing disaster risks, including understanding disaster risk, strengthening disaster risk governance for management of disaster risk, investing in disaster reduction for resilience, and enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response. This book presents ideas to address the challenges facing different components of spatial patterns related to ecological processes, and the published articles extended versions of selected presentations from the Gi4DM Conference in 2019 in Prague.},

  abstract = {An environmental problem which is of concern across the globe nowadays is air pollution. The extent of air pollution is often studied based on data on the observed level of air pollution. Although the analysis of air pollution data that is available in the literature is numerous, studies on the dynamics of air pollution with the allowance for spatial interaction effects through the use of the Markov chain model are very limited. Accordingly, this study aims to explore the potential impact of spatial dependence over time and space on the distribution of air pollution based on the spatial Markov chain (SMC) model using the longitudinal air pollution index (API) data. This SMC model is pertinent to be applied since the daily data of API from 2012 to 2014 that have been gathered from 37 different air quality stations in Peninsular Malaysia is found to exhibit the property of spatial autocorrelation. Based on the spatial transition probability matrices found from the SMC model, specific characteristics of air pollution are studied in the regional context. These characteristics are the long-run proportion and the mean first passage time for each state of air pollution. It is found that the probability for a particular station's state to remain good is 0.814 if its neighbors are in a good state of air pollution and 0.7082 if its neighbors are in a moderate state. For a particular station having neighbors in a good state of air pollution, the proportion of time for it to continue being in a good state is 0.6. This proportion reduces to 0.4, 0.01, and 0 for the cell of moderate, unhealthy, and very unhealthy states, respectively. In addition, there exists a significant spatial dependence of API, indicating that air pollution for a particular station is dependent on the states of the neighboring stations.},

  abstract = {The analysis of air pollution behavior is becoming crucial, where information on air pollution behavior is vital for managing air quality events. Many studies have described the stochastic behavior of air pollution based on the Markov chain (MC) models. Fitting the optimum order of MC models is essential for describing the stochastic process. However, uncertainty remains concerning the optimum order of such models for representing and characterizing air pollution index (API) data. In this study, the optimum order of the MC models for hourly and daily API sequences from seven stations in the central region of Peninsular Malaysia is identified, based on the Bayesian information criteria (BIC), contributing to exploring an adequate explanation of the probabilistic dependence of air pollution. A summary of the statistics for the API was calculated prior to the analysis. The Markov property and the divergence for the empirically estimated transition matrix of an MC sequence are also investigated. It is found from the analysis that the optimum order varies from one station to another. At most stations, for both observed and simulated API data, the second and third orders of the MC models are found to be optimum for hourly API occurrences, while the first-order MC is found to be most fitting for describing the dynamics of the daily API. Overall, fitting the optimum order of the MC model for the API data sequence captured the delay effect of air pollution. Accordingly, we concluded that the air quality standard lies within controllable limits, except for some infrequent occurrences of API values exceeding the unhealthy level.},

Using Bamenda in North West Cameroon as a test case, we investigated two completely unsupervised pixel based approaches to extract tree/shrub (TS) and ground vegetation (GV) cover from an IKONOS derived soil adjusted vegetation index. These included: (1) a simple Jenks Natural Breaks classification and (2) a two-step technique that combined the Jenks algorithm with agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Both techniques were compared with each other and with a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) for classification performance. While overall classification accuracy was generally high for all techniques ({\textquestiondown}90\%), One-Way Analysis of Variance tests revealed the two step technique to outperform the simple Jenks classification in terms of predicting the GV class. It also outperformed the SVM in predicting the TS class. We conclude that the unsupervised methods are technically as good and practically superior for efficient urban vegetation mapping in budget and technically constrained regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa.},

Likelihood ratio tests and \${\textbackslash}chi\^2\$-tests of the form used in contingency tables are obtained for testing the following hypotheses: (a) that the transition probabilities of a first order chain are constant, (b) that in case the transition probabilities are constant, they are specified numbers, and (c) that the process is a \$u\$th order Markov chain against the alternative it is \$r\$th but not \$u\$th order. In case \$u = 0\$ and \$r = 1\$, case (c) results in tests of the null hypothesis that observations at successive time points are statistically independent against the alternate hypothesis that observations are from a first order Markov chain. Tests of several other hypotheses are also considered. The statistical analysis in the case of a single observation of a long chain is also discussed. There is some discussion of the relation between likelihood ratio criteria and \${\textbackslash}chi\^2\$-tests of the form used in contingency tables.},

It uses Stats19 road accident data from the London Metropolitan Police, specifically postcode information relating to the driver and casualty of each road accident from 1999 to 2003. Experian's Mosaic software was used to append each postcode to a geodemographic Mosaic type. The results showed distinct spatial and statistical prevalence of certain groups within society to be more at risk of being in a road accident. This highlights the need for a more sophisticated understanding of the different risks people face as they engage in the road environment.},

We use the 1986 cohort of the Swedish population and follow them from age 15 when they are living at home to age 30. We find that by age 30, they live in a neighbourhood that in terms of the poverty level is relatively distant from the initial neighbourhood where they grew up. Mobility into less poor neighbourhoods is clearly linked to higher income, but interestingly, initial context is even more important. Mobility to less poor neighbourhoods is found for those starting in high-poverty neighbourhoods and vice versa for those starting in low-poverty neighbourhoods. Moreover, large-scale context and regional context strongly influence neighbourhood mobility along the poverty gradient. The analysis shows that a large proportion of individuals with a non-European background improve their neighbourhood status from where they were living as teenagers, to where they live after leaving home. Individuals who stay in the poorest neighbourhoods come from less favourable backgrounds, from largescale poverty contexts, have low school grades, tend to have children early, and have low incomes and lower educational attainment. Individuals with a non-European background are overrepresented in this group. Thus, despite the overall gains in neighbourhood quality, the process of spatial sorting still contributes to an increased spatial concentration of vulnerable populations.},

Widely adopted measures of urban poverty, such as the concentrated poverty index, may violate some of the desirable properties we outline. Furthermore, we show that changes of urban poverty within the same city are additively decomposable into the contribution of demographic, convergence, re-ranking and spatial effects.

We study the trend and drivers of urban poverty across American cities over the last 40 years. To do so, we resort to a family of urban poverty indices that account for features of incidence, distribution, and segregation of poverty across census tracts. Compared to the universally-adopted concentrated poverty index, these measures have a solid normative background. We use tract-level data to assess the extent to which demographics, housing, education, employment, and income distribution affect levels and changes in urban poverty. A decomposition study allows to single out the effect of changes in the distribution of these variables across cities from changes in their correlation with urban poverty. We find that demographics and income distribution have a substantial role in explaining urban poverty patterns, whereas the same effects remarkably differ when using the concentrated poverty indices.},

  abstract = {The capabilities for visualization, rapid data retrieval, and manipulation in geographic information systems (GIS) have created the need for new techniques of exploratory data analysis that focus on the ``spatial'' aspects of the data. The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ``outliers,'' as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

We demonstrate analytically and by means of a series of simulation experiments how evidence of the removal of spatial autocorrelation by spatial fixed effects may be spurious when the true data generating processes (DGP) takes the form of a spatial lag or spatial error dependence. In addition, we also show that spatial fixed effects correctly remove spatial correlation only in the special case where the dependence is group-wise, with all observations in the same group as neighbours of each other.},

  abstract = {Tu et al present an analysis of the equivalence of three paradoxes, namely, Simpson's, Lord's, and the suppression phenomena. They conclude that all three simply reiterate the occurrence of a change in the association of any two variables when a third variable is statistically controlled for. This is not surprising because reversal or change in magnitude is common in conditional analysis. At the heart of the phenomenon of change in magnitude, with or without reversal of effect estimate, is the question of which to use: the unadjusted (combined table) or adjusted (sub-table) estimate. Hence, Simpson's paradox and related phenomena are a problem of covariate selection and adjustment (when to adjust or not) in the causal analysis of non-experimental data. It cannot be overemphasized that although these paradoxes reveal the perils of using statistical criteria to guide causal analysis, they hold neither the explanations of the phenomenon they depict nor the pointers on how to avoid them. The explanations and solutions lie in causal reasoning which relies on background knowledge, not statistical criteria.},

We encounter this case when we study the individual behaviour of economic agents, such as families, firms, labour unions or governmental units, interacting in a study area. In particular the concern of this chapter is with the mechanism through which the individual agents' behaviour gives rise to spatial relationships.},

Levels of inequality substantially differ among US states, and convergence analysis examines whether those differences have decreased over time. We show weak evidence of inequality convergence from 1917 to 2012. Convergence is found only in the 1932{\textendash}1985 subsample. Subsample analysis shows divergence in the 1917{\textendash}1931 and 1986{\textendash}2012 subsamples, where we find different convergence clubs. Lack of convergence, or the existence of various convergence clubs, suggests that some US states approach different steady states in the long run. These convergence clubs are mainly determined by human capital and government policies. We find that redistributive policies and easy access to education reduce inequality; capital gains tax is also an efficient policy measure.},

Despite important differences between these two types of dependence, one is easily mistaken for the other, and the possibility that both are at work is commonly ignored. We fit a series of hierarchical and spatially-explicit multilevel models to a U.S. county-level life dataset of life expectancy in 1999 to demonstrate approaches for data analysis and interpretation when multiple sources of area-clustering are present. We demonstrate the methods to detect, interpret, and differentiate evidence of spatial and geographic membership effects and discuss key considerations for analyzing data with spatial or/and membership dimensions. We find evidence that life expectancy is driven by both within-state geographic process, and by spatial processes. We argue that considering spatial and membership processes simultaneously yields valuable insights into the patterning of area variations in health.},

Certainly, there exists a branch of urban economics that has paid substantial attention to urban employment centers, but the efforts have been focused on identification methodologies. In this paper we build on such body of research and combine it with insights from the latest contributions in the sister subfield of city size distributions to push the agenda forward in terms of the understanding of these phenomena. We consider the 359 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States in the year 2000 and reach three main conclusions: First, employment center sizes are more unevenly distributed than city sizes; second, the two functions that best describe city size distributions, namely the lognormal and the double Pareto-lognormal, also offer a good fit for the case of centers, particularly the latter; and third, several interesting statistically significant relationships (correlations) between variables related to centers and MSAs are deduced. Further experiments with a different technique of center identification suggest that the results are fairly robust to the method of choice.},

The analysis draws on many of the techniques most commonly used by regional scientists, such as choropleth mapping, spatial autocorrelation, and point pattern analysis. In doing so, the chapter presents a practical roadmap for performing a completely open and reproducible analysis in regional science. In particular, we deal with the automation of (1) synchronizing code and text, (2) presenting results in figures and tables, and (3) generating reference lists. In addition, we discuss the significant added value of version control systems and their role in enhancing transparency through public, open repositories. With this chapter, we aim to practically illustrate a set of principles and techniques that facilitate transparency and reproducibility in empirical research, both keys to the health and credibility of regional science in the next 50 years to come.},

  abstract = {The analysis of regional convergence often stays at the level of documentation, with limited attention placed on the drivers of convergence/divergence dynamics. This article offers a systematic analysis of this, examining the role of first-nature (location, proximity, physical geography) and second-nature geography (economic structure, agglomeration, economic potential) in accounting for regional synchronicity in growth trajectories (stochastic convergence). Utilising historical data for Greece at the prefectural level and up-to-date time-series econometric techniques, we test for the presence of stochastic convergence in the country over three decades prior to the crisis; identify the pairs of regions which exhibit co-movement in their growth dynamics; and examine the covariates of this. Our results unveil a picture of limited-only and cluster-like convergence, driven predominantly by factors related to accessibility, sectoral specialisations, labour market dynamism, market potential and selected locational characteristics. This supports two propositions: (a) convergence is an endogenous process, related to shared and incongruent characteristics of regions; and, by implication, (b) regional disparities are structural (in the sense that they are linked to economic and spatial structure) and thus require targeted policies in order to be addressed.},

Geodemographic profiles of the characteristics of individuals and small areas are pivotal to tactical and strategic resource management in many areas of business, and are becoming similarly central to efficient and effective deployment of resources by public services. In this context, this paper describes research that has been developed in partnership with the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary and Institute of Criminal Justice Studies (ICJS) at the University of Portsmouth to assess the potential use of geodemographics as a policing tool. Crime, the fear of crime and the efficacy of public services are issues that have moved to the top of the UK political agenda and have long been matters of serious public concern. This paper considers the ways in which police forces might use geodemographics to better deploy resources at a variety of spatial scales in England and Wales. {\textcopyright} Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.},

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 10,027 children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. The exposure variable was parents' subjective neighborhood safety. The outcomes were three domains of children's cognitive performance: general cognitive performance, executive functioning, and learning/memory. We used mixed-effects regression models for data analysis. Results: Overall, parents' subjective neighborhood safety was positively associated with children's executive functioning, but not general cognitive performance or learning/memory. Higher parents' subjective neighborhood safety had a more positive influence on the executive functioning of non-Hispanic White than Asian American children. Higher parents' subjective neighborhood safety was associated with higher general cognitive performance and learning/memory for non-White children relative to non-Hispanic White children. Conclusion: The race/ethnicity of children moderates the association between neighborhood safety and cognitive performance. This becomes more complicated, as the patterns seem to differ across ethnicity and cognitive domains. It is unknown whether the observed racial/ethnic variations in the effect of neighborhood safety on cognitive performance are neighborhood characteristics such as residential segregation. Addressing neighborhood inequalities is needed if we wish to reduce racial/ethnic inequities in the cognitive development of children.},

The emergence of Open Data at an urban level is an exceptional opportunity for the field.

  abstract = {Three approaches to modelling spatial data in which simulation plays a vital role are described and illustrated with examples. The first approach uses flexible regression models, such as generalized additive models, together with locational covariates to fit a surface to spatial data. We show how the bootstrap can be used to quantify the effects of model selection uncertainty and to avoid oversmoothing. The second approach, which is appropriate for binary data, allows for local spatial correlation by the inclusion in a logistic regression model of a covariate derived from neighbouring values of the response variable. The resulting autologistic model can be fitted to survey data obtained from a random sample of sites by incorporating the Gibbs sampler into the modelling procedure. We show how this modelling strategy can be used not only to fit the autologistic model to sites included in the survey, but also to estimate the probability that a certain species is present in the unsurveyed sites. Our third approach relates to the analysis of spatio-temporal data. Here we model the distribution of a plant or animal species as a function of the distribution at an earlier time point. The bootstrap is used to estimate parameters and quantify their precision. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We evaluate the performance of different regionalization methods for realizations families using internal and external measures of regiona\- lization quality. A large number of regionalization quality metrics expose a detailed profile of the analyzed methods' strengths and weaknesses. We investigate the computational efficiency of every method as a function of the number of spatial units studied.

Second, when comparing these results with those obtained for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, we show that the convergence pattern detected with GDP per capita is more pronounced: ECO-DEV adjusts slower over time compared to GDP per capita. Third, pictures provided by the remaining interesting factors, capturing educational attainment, population dynamics and employment, are very different.},

We use detailed data on Brazilian intergovernmental grants whose allocations are determined by legislators. The executive branch cannot interfere with the destiny and volume of grants, but it can control the pace of transfers. We group the data into municipalities and estimate the effects of the share of aligned legislators associated with a municipality on the average time to receive grants. We show that legislators politically aligned to the executive branch transfer resources to their constituencies nine months faster than unaligned legislators. To achieve a causal interpretation of these results, we use an exogenous variation in the share of elected aligned legislators caused by the phased-in introduction of electronic voting. Our findings regarding how political alignment affects the speed of transfer are consistent across different periods and alternative definitions of the dependent variable.},

A number of brain regions connected in what's dubbed the Default Mode Network (DMN) are always grinding away, engaged in a number of different involuntary activities that neuroscientists collectively call mindwandering: from daydreaming and self-chatter to ruminating about the past and worrying about the future. Not only does all of this inner commotion tug our attention away from the present moment, but it can dampen the quality of our experience, lowering our mood and potentially contributing to anxiety and depression. Yet, there's method to this apparent madness. Mindwandering is our brain's way of developing our sense of self, trying to sort out what others are thinking, and searching for associations to help us interpret what's happening in our lives. It can be both positive and negative. On one hand, can become so engaged in this consideration of the past and making predictions about the future that for much of the time we are disconnected from what is actually happening in the moment. On the other, we can become more aware of where our minds are wandering, learning to direct them to stimulate creative, increase our ability to focus, and boost our mood. We want, in short, to work toward being able to bring the right mind to the right time. Mindwandering is the first book to expose readers to the multi-faceted phenomenon of their wandering minds, the new and exciting research of the brain and the mind behind this default mode of ours, when it is beneficial and when it is harming us to wander, and how we can gain some control over our mental lives. In doing so, Mindwandering will bring to readers the rare and marvelous convergence of advanced neuroscience with ancient wisdom; cognitive psychology with creativity and mood; and the brain's default state linked to the quality of our daily experience"--},

  abstract = {Gun-related violence exposure is a significant public health problem for urban youth. Few studies have implemented methods to estimate the spatial influence of activity spaces on gun violence exposure constrained by the physical configuration of walkable street networks. The present research uses computational network and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation methods to explore gun violence exposure along the walkable streets near schools in Compton, California. Findings demonstrated strong evidence that gun violence is clustered at all distances along the pedestrian network and in proximity to Compton Unified School District (K-12) schools, reaching a maximum between 1.2 and 1.8 mi; thereafter  the ``attractiveness'' of schools to gun violence was inhibiting. Almost all schools had at least one shooting within a 5-min walk (i.e., about 400~m); 37.8\% of schools had an average shooting distance of less than 400~m; about 250 incidents occurred within 5~min of schools; and about 30 schools had a shooting within a 5-min walking distance. Determining the spatial extent of violence exposure in proximity to key activity spaces for youth, such as schools, has substantial implications for the health and wellbeing of~youth living in violence-prone areas. The public health and legal implications of this study are discussed in context.},

  abstract = {Spatially autocorrelated species abundance or distribution datasets typically generate spatially autocorrelated residuals in generalized linear models; a broader modelling framework is therefore required. Auto-logistic and related auto-models, implemented approximately as autocovariate regression, provide simple and direct modelling of spatial dependence. The autologistic model has been widely applied in ecology since Augustin, Mugglestone and Buckland (Journal of Applied Ecology, 1996, 33, 339) analysed red deer census data using a hybrid estimation approach, combining maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation with Gibbs sampling of missing data. However Dormann (Ecological Modelling, 2007, 207, 234) questioned the validity of auto-logistic regression even for fully-observed data, giving examples of apparent underestimation of covariate parameters in analysis of simulated `snouter' data. Extending this critique to include auto-Poisson and uncentered auto-normal models, Dormann et al. (Ecography, 2007, 30, 609) found likewise that covariate parameters estimated via autocovariate regression bore little resemblance to values used to generate `snouter' data. We note that all the above studies employ neighbourhood weighting schemes inconsistent with auto-model definitions; in the auto-Poisson case, a further inconsistency was the failure to exclude cooperative interactions. We investigate the impact of these implementation errors on auto-model estimation using both empirical and simulated datasets. We show that when `snouter' data is reanalysed using valid weightings, very different estimates are obtained for covariate parameters. For auto-logistic and auto-normal models, the new estimates agree closely with values used to generate the `snouter' simulations. Re-analysis of the red deer data shows that invalid neighbourhood weightings generate only small estimation errors for the full dataset, but larger errors occur on geographic subsamples. A substantial fraction of papers employing auto-logistic regression use these invalid neighbourhood weightings, which are embedded as default options in the widely used `spdep' spatial dependence package for R. Auto-logistic analyses conducted using invalid neighbourhood weightings will be erroneous to an extent that can vary widely. These analyses can easily be corrected by using valid neighbourhood weightings available in `spdep'. The hybrid estimation approach for missing data is readily adapted for valid neighbourhood weighting schemes and is implemented here in R for application to sparse presence-absence data.},

  abstract = {One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is that it disproportionately affects people from some specific ethnic and socio-economic minorities. In particular, since from the beginning of the pandemic it has been clear that people from Black and African American backgrounds seem to be hit especially hard by the virus, creating a substantial infection gap. The observed abnormal impact on these ethnic groups could probably be due to the co-occurrence of other known risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation and response to cures, although those factors do not seem able to explain fully and in depth the excess incidence of infections and deaths among African Americans. Here, we introduce the concept of diffusion segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on major US cities, we found that the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in African American communities at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly associated with their level of diffusion segregation. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is potentially much more important to contain and curb the spreading of infectious diseases.},

The paper develops a method for assessing the success of this spatial targeting. It uses a geodemographic classification system to produce a generalised socioeconomic profile for a particular initiative. This profile can be used to examine the targeting of the initiative in different localities, in order to assess whether targeting has been inefficient (the targeted areas have been defined so that many of the people they contain are in fact not those for whom the initiative is intended) or incomplete (deserving cases have been missed because the initiative's boundaries have been drawn too tightly). The utility of the method is demonstrated by employing the P-2 People and Places geodemographic system to assess the targeting of the Sure Start initiative in eight large provincial cities in England.},

Here we present an effort to extend traditional land use{\textendash}transport interaction (LUTI) models to extensive spatial systems so that they are able to track increasingly wide repercussions on the location of population, employment and related distributions of spatial interactions. The prototype model framework we propose and implement called QUANT is available anywhere, at any time, at any place, and is open to any user. It is characterised as a set of web-based services within which simulation, visualisation and scenario generation are configured. We begin by presenting the core spatial interaction model built around the journey to work, and extend this to deal with many sectors. We detail the computational environment, with a focus on the size of the problem which is an application to a 8436 zone system comprising England, Scotland and Wales generating matrices of around 71 million cells. We detail the data and spatial system, showing how we extend the model to visualise spatial interactions as vector fields and accessibility indicators. We briefly demonstrate the implementation of the model and outline how we can generate the impact of changes in employment and changes in travel costs that enable transport modes to compete for travellers. We conclude by indicating that the power of the new framework consists of running hundreds of `what if?' scenarios which let the user immediately evaluate their impacts and then evolve new and better ones.},

  abstract = {Recent scholarship has examined changes in the geographic distribution of poor persons in America, but it remains unclear whether high- and low- poverty neighborhoods have become more, or less, spatially clustered over the past several decades. Additionally, while many have argued that growth in both high-poverty spatial clusters and high-low poverty spatial clusters could yield conditions that are conducive to increases in homicide, previous research has not considered that possibility. We contribute to knowledge by examining whether there have been important shifts in the spatial clustering of poverty in America between 1980 and 2010, and if so, whether those shifts were related to changes in homicide during the period. The descriptive results of our study reveal that there were notable changes in population exposure to both high- poverty and high-low poverty spatial clusters between 1980 and 2010. Fixed-effects negative binomial regression models yield limited support for the idea that changes in spatial inequality, as measured by the clustering of high- and low-poverty neighborhoods, are associated with changes in homicide rates. In contrast, the results indicate a significant positive association between changes in exposure to very high-poverty spatial clusters and homicide trends. The findings affirm the importance of considering the spatial dynamics of demographic conditions when explaining changes in violence across communities.},

In this paper we discuss the real world application of a location-allocation case study (approx 800 students, 500 schools) from UCL using public transport. The use of public transportation is key for this case study, as many location-allocation approaches only make use of drive-time or walking-time distances, but the location of UCL in Greater London, UK makes the inclusion of public transport vital for this case study. The location-allocation is implemented as a capacitated p-median location-allocation model, using the spopt library, part of the Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL). The capacitated variation of the p-median location-allocation problem is a new addition to the spopt library, which this work will present. The results from the initial version of the capacitated p-median location-allocation problem has shown a marked improvement on public transport travel time, with public transport travel time reduced by 891 minutes overall for an initial sample of 93 students (9.58 minutes per student). Results will be presented below and plans for further improvement shared.},

  abstract = {Macroeconomics and regional science have developed as separate disciplines. However, the fact that the gross domestic product is the sum of gross regional products suggests that the two disciplines are related. The present study considers the implications of regional science and economic geography for macroeconomics. Specifically, a spatial econometric model for Israel is simulated to explore the implications of regional productivity and amenity shocks for gross regional products and the gross domestic product. We show that the effects of productivity shocks on the gross domestic product depend on where they occur and may even be negative. These results question estimates of the effect of productivity shocks in macroeconomic models in terms of spatial aggregation bias. They also provide empirical evidence rejecting the spatial granularity hypothesis regarding the secular relation between macroeconomic economic activity and regional economic activity. The study concludes with speculations about the implications of macroeconomics for regional science.},

For a better understanding of these processes, the present study investigates the main strengths of the multi-group residential indices, testing sensitivity and reliability under different metropolitan contexts in five European countries. These indices focus on different research dimensions and approach multi-group residential segregation conceptually and mathematically in a different way. A multivariate exploratory data analysis was adopted to classify the observed segregation patterns into a few homogeneous types and to delineate the multivariate relationship between the indices. The results of principal component analysis demonstrate that the indices assessing uniformity and disproportionality of the social groups analysed (H and D) contribute largely to the diversification in today's multi-ethnic communities, clarifying the importance of the dimension of evenness. Our results highlight how segregation is more evident in economically disadvantaged metropolitan regions with high levels of social vulnerability.},

  abstract = {Background: The Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) was created in 1933 to provide government backing of troubled mortgages during the Great Depression. Residential security maps were created to guide investment in over 200 US cities. Neighborhoods were assigned grades of `A' through `D' (with corresponding color coding of green, blue, yellow and red) to indicate desirability for investment. Neighborhoods with a high percentage of African Americans or other minorities were frequently assigned grades of `C' or `D'. These maps are now most associated with redlining, or the process of denial of credit for real estate investment based on race. Resulting economic disparities endure in areas of many US cities today. We hypothesized that there would be a correlation between redlined areas on the 1937 map of Louisville, KY to the prevalence of gun violence today. Methods: Gunshot victims (GSV) and their residential addresses within the city of Louisville were examined between 2012 and 2018. GSVs were aggregated within census block groups to approximate neighborhoods. The spatial distribution of GSVs was analyzed against the original HOLC neighborhood grade. Additional control variables adapted from the 2013{\textendash}2017 American Community Survey were included to account for other possible explanations for the spatial distribution of GSVs. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression with a spatial component was used to determine incidence rate ratios (IRR) for the relative likelihood of GSVs within neighborhoods. Results: Relative to green-graded neighborhoods, red-graded neighborhoods had five times as many GSVs. This difference remained statistically significant after accounting for differences in demographic, racial, and housing characteristics of the neighborhoods. Conclusion: Redlined neighborhoods within Louisville, KY in 1937 had significantly more GSVs today. The impact of historical and institutional racism on modern gun violence merits acknowledgement and further study.},

Even if it is possible to evaluate each transition matrix using a standard association measure, these measures do not allow taking into account all the available information. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a new class of so-called "predictive power" measures for transition matrices.

  abstract = {Socio-spatial segregation has been recognised as an important factor affecting school segregation and educational attainment in urban schools. As urban populations grow and socio-spatial segregation has become a pressing issue in many contexts, a more sophisticated understanding of the interconnections between spatial and school segregation is needed, including the role of school catchment areas as a possible mediating factor. In our article, we focus on the two-way relationship between urban residential mobility and catchment area segregation in Helsinki, Finland. Using fine-grain statistical data we analyse how the long-term changes in spatial segregation have changed catchment area populations and how residential mobility of families with children is, in turn, related to catchment area composition. The analysis focuses on the majority population whose residential choices typically have the strongest impact on segregation patterns in cities. Our main finding is that there is a systematic relationship between socio-spatial segregation and catchment area differentiation, where the disadvantaged areas are consistently left behind in the general socio-economic development. Even though the institutional school quality is high throughout the city, the residential choices of families with children feed into the self-perpetuating cycles of segregation, as the most disadvantaged areas are rejected and privileged areas favoured in mobility patterns. The results highlight the need for urban educational policies with a high sensitivity to the persistent socio-spatial inequalities shaping educational opportunities.},

  abstract = {There has been much recent interest in Bayesian image analysis, including such topics as removal of blur and noise, detection of object boundaries, classification of textures, and reconstruction of two- or three-dimensional scenes from noisy lower-dimensional views. Perhaps the most straightforward task is that of image restoration, though it is often suggested that this is an area of relatively minor practical importance. The present paper argues the contrary, since many problems in the analysis of spatial data can be interpreted as problems of image restoration. Furthermore, the amounts of data involved allow routine use of computer intensive methods, such as the Gibbs sampler, that are not yet practicable for conventional images. Two examples are given, one in archeology, the other in epidemiology. These are preceded by a partial review of pixel-based Bayesian image analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper is an expository survey of the mathematical aspects of statistical inference as it applies to finite Markov chains, the problem being to draw inferences about the transition probabilities from one long, unbroken observation \${\textbackslash}\{x\_1, x\_2, {\textbackslash}cdots, x\_n{\textbackslash}\}\$ on the chain. The topics covered include Whittle's formula, chi-square and maximum-likelihood methods, estimation of parameters, and multiple Markov chains. At the end of the paper it is briefly indicated how these methods can be applied to a process with an arbitrary state space or a continuous time parameter. Section 2 contains a simple proof of Whittle's formula; Section 3 provides an elementary and self-contained development of the limit theory required for the application of chi-square methods to finite chains. In the remainder of the paper, the results are accompanied by references to the literature, rather than by complete proofs. As is usual in a review paper, the emphasis reflects the author's interests. Other general accounts of statistical inference on Markov processes will be found in Grenander [53], Bartlett [9] and [10], Fortet [35], and in my monograph [18]. I would like to thank Paul Meier for a number of very helpful discussions on the topics treated in this paper, particularly those of Section 3.},

Methods of statistical inference may also be provided, but these will, like the measures themselves, depend on the support of the observations, chosen assumptions, and the way in which spatial association is represented; spatial weights are often used as a representational technique. In addition, assumptions may be made about the underlying mean model, and about error distributions. Different software implementations may choose to expose these choices to the analyst, but the sets of choices available may vary between these implementations, as may default settings.

  abstract = {This paper presents and discusses four different approaches to the study of how individuals' income and education during adulthood are related to their family background. The most well-known approach, intergenerational mobility, describes how parents' and offspring's income or education are related to each other. The intergenerational-effect literature addresses the question how an intervention that changes parental income or education causally affects their children's outcome. The sibling-correlation approach estimates the share of total inequality that is attributed to factors shared by siblings. This share is generally substantially higher than what is revealed by intergenerational mobility estimates. Finally, the equality-of-opportunity approach is looking for a set of factors, in the family background and otherwise, that are important for children's outcomes and that children cannot be held accountable for. We argue that all four approaches are most informative and that recent research has provided insightful results. However, by comparing results from the different approaches, it is possible to paint a more nuanced picture of the role of family background. Thus, we recommend that scholars working in the four subfields pay more attention to each other's research.},

  abstract = {Anecdotal evidence suggests that the affordable housing crisis is forcing households to seek lower cost housing in the outer reaches of major metropolitan areas, helping to explain recent increases in commute distance. To test this relationship, we use spatial regression to examine the relationship between the availability of affordable housing in close proximity to jobs (jobs-housing fit) and commute distance in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The analysis draws on 2015 Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin{\textendash}Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) by workplace supplemented with data from the 2013{\textendash}2017 5-Year American Community Survey on affordable housing units. We find substantial variation in jobs-housing fit across Los Angeles neighborhoods. The imbalance is greatest in higher-income neighborhoods located along the coast and in Orange County, south of Los Angeles. Controlling for other determinants of commute distance, a higher ratio of jobs to affordable housing is associated with longer distance commutes. To address growing commute distances, policymakers must greatly expand and protect the supply of long-term rental housing particularly in job-rich neighborhoods.},

The spatial sciences have recently seen growing calls for more accessible software and tools that better embody geographic science and theory. Urban spatial network science offers one clear opportunity: from multiple perspectives, tools to model and analyze non-planar urban spatial networks have traditionally been inaccessible, atheoretical, or otherwise limiting. This article reflects on this state of the field. Then it discusses the motivation, experience, and outcomes of developing OSMnx, a tool intended to help address this. Next it reviews this tool's use in the recent multidisciplinary spatial network science literature to highlight upstream and downstream benefits of open-source software development. Tool-building is an essential but poorly incentivized component of academic geography and social science more broadly. To conduct better science, we need to build better tools.

First, it introduces early theories, models, and deductive methods from which the field originated before shifting toward induction. Then, it explores urban network analytics that enrich traditional representations of spatial interaction and structure. Next, it discusses urban applications of spatiotemporal big data and machine learning. Finally, it argues that privacy and ethical concerns are too often ignored as ubiquitous monitoring and analytics can empower social repression. We conclude with a call for a more critical urban analytics that recognizes its epistemological limits, emphasizes human dignity, and learns from and supports marginalized communities.},

Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, multimedia databases have become increasingly important in many application areas such as medicine, CAD, geography, or molecular biology. An important research issue in the field of multimedia databases is the content based retrieval of similar multimedia objects such as images, text, and videos. However, in contrast to searching data in a relational database, a content based retrieval requires the search of similar objects as a basic functionality of the database system. Most of the approaches addressing similarity search use a so-called feature transformation which transforms important properties of the multimedia objects into high-dimensional points (feature vectors). Thus, the similarity search is transformed into a search of points in the feature space which are close to a given query point in the high-dimensional feature space. Query Processing in high-dimensional spaces has therefore been a very active research area over the last few years. A number of new index structures and algorithms have been proposed. It has been shown that the new index structures considerably improve the performance in querying large multimedia databases. Based on recent tutorials [BK 98, BK 00], in this survey we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in querying multimedia databases, describing the index structures and algorithms for an efficient query processing in high-dimensional spaces. We identify the problems of processing queries in high-dimensional space, and we provide an overview of the proposed approaches to overcome these problems.},

The approach is based on the notion that there are two fundamental characteristics of categorical spatial data; composition and configuration. Further, it is argued that, when considered locally, the latter should be measured conditionally with respect to the former. These ideas are developed for binary, gridded data. Local composition is measured by counting the numbers of cells of a particular type, while local configuration is measured by join counts. The approach is illustrated using a small, empirical data set and an ad hoc procedure is developed to deal with the impact of global spatial autocorrelation on the local statistics.},

Based on a review of existing pattern measures in cartography, geography, image analysis, and landscape ecology, two fundamental classes of such measures, termed compositional and configurational, are identified. The paper focuses on configurational measures and it is suggested that as many as five such measures (join counts, patch numbers, patch sizes, patch proximity, and distribution of the classes relative to the focal cell of the window) are required to differentiate between all possible local categorical maps. This suggestion is explored by examining aspects of the statistical behaviour (probability distributions and correlations between extreme values of pairs of measures) of a set of 12 configurational measures. Their use is also demonstrated by means of an empirical example.},

Three data-driven bandwidth selectors are proposed to estimate the optimal bandwidth. One of them is based on a new smooth bootstrap proposal which is proved to be consistent under a Poisson assumption. The other two are a rule-of-thumb method based on assuming normality, and a simple non-model-based approach. An extensive simulation study is accomplished considering Poisson and non-Poisson scenarios, and including a comparison with other competitors.

The proposed index can be used in a test for the independence of two criteria used to rank the units of a sample, against their concordance/discordance. It can then be regarded as a competitor of other classical methods, such as Kendall's tau. The exact distribution of the proposed test-statistic under the null hypothesis of independence is studied and its expectation and variance are determined; moreover, the asymptotic distribution of the test-statistic is derived. Finally, the implementation of the proposed test and its performance are discussed.},

  abstract = {Inequality is typically measured as the degree of dispersion of a distribution of individual attributes, say, wealth, as is captured for example by the Lorenz curve, and its associated statistic, the Gini coefficient. But both the economics and social psychology of experienced inequality are better expressed by differences between an individual and others. There is a natural way to do this using the standard definition of the Gini coefficient as one half the mean difference among individuals, relative to the population mean wealth. Here we show that reformulating the Gini coefficient as a measure of experienced inequality on a complete social network yields a computational algorithm that, unlike the conventional one, is consistent with this definition and irrespective of population size varies from 0 (no differences among individuals) to 1 (one individual owns all the wealth). Our proposed measure also avoids a downward bias in the standard algorithm, which for small populations can be substantial. Because social networks are far from complete, the pairwise comparisons based on social interactions in which people routinely engage may support a level of experienced inequality that either exceeds or falls short of the Gini coefficient measured on a hypothetical complete network. We illustrate this fact with empirical estimates for a farming community in Nicaragua.},

We investigate how these forms of spatial aggregation error can guide a regionalization over a spatial domain of interest. By ``regionalization'' we mean a specification of geographies that define the spatial support for areal data. This topic has been studied vigorously by geographers, but has been given less attention by spatial statisticians. Thus, we propose a criterion for spatial aggregation error (CAGE), which we minimize to obtain an optimal regionalization. To define CAGE we draw a connection between spatial aggregation error and a new multiscale representation of the Karhunen-Loe{\textasciiacute}ve (K-L) expansion. This relationship between CAGE and the multiscale K-L expansion leads to illuminating theoretical developments including: connections between spatial aggregation error, squared prediction error, spatial variance, and a novel extension of Obled-Creutin eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through an analysis of two datasets, one using the American Community Survey and one related to environmental ocean winds.},

  abstract = {Considerable attention focuses on the risks of poverty, defined as individual-level labor market and family characteristics more common among the poor than the non-poor. This article first develops a framework for analyzing the risks of poverty in terms of prevalences (share of the population with a risk) and penalties (increased probability of poverty associated with a risk). Comparing the four major risks (low education, single motherhood, young headship, and unemployment) across 29 rich democracies, we show there is greater variation in penalties than prevalences. Second, we apply this framework to the U.S. We show that prevalences cannot explain high U.S. poverty as the U.S. has below average prevalences. Rather, the U.S. has high poverty partly because it has the highest penalties. U.S. poverty would decline more with crossnational median penalties than cross-national median prevalences, and U.S. poverty in 2013 would actually be worse with prevalences from 1970 or 1980. Third, we analyze cross-national variation in prevalences and penalties. We find very little evidence that higher penalties discourage prevalences, or that lower penalties encourage prevalences. We also show welfare generosity significantly moderates the penalties for unemployment and low education. We conclude with three broader implications. First, a focus on risks is unlikely to provide a convincing explanation or effective strategy for poverty. Second, despite being the subject of the most research, single motherhood may be the least important of the risks. Third, for general explanations of poverty, studies based solely on the U.S. are constrained by potentially large sample selection biases.},

  abstract = {Misuse of alcohol is a significant public health problem, potentially resulting in unintentional injuries, motor vehicle crashes, drownings, and, perhaps of greatest concern, serious acts of violence, including assaults, rapes, suicides, and homicides. Although previous research establishes a link between alcohol consumption increased levels of violence, studies relating the density of alcohol outlets (e.g., restaurants, bars, liquor stores) and the likelihood of violent crime have been less common. In this paper we test for such a relationship at the small area level, using data from 79 neighborhoods in the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. We adopt a fully Bayesian point of view using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computational methods as available in the popular and freely available WinBUGS language. Our models control for important covariates (e.g., neighborhood racial heterogeneity, age heterogeneity) and also account for spatial association in unexplained variability using conditionally autoregressive (CAR) random effects. Our results indicate a significant positive relationship between alcohol outlet density and violent crime, while also permitting easy mapping of neighborhood-level predicted and residual values, the former useful for intervention in the most at-risk neighborhoods and the latter potentially useful in identifying covariates still missing from the fixed effects portion of the model. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

  abstract = {In this article we explore the claim that spatial interactions among cities are significant drivers of their growth. We assert that reallocation of ideas among cities is a source of improved allocation of resources. We propose a closed economy, agent-based model that is in constant flux. It is populated by autonomous agents that compete and adjust constantly their behavior in reaction to the conditions they perceive. The economy is a dynamic, self-organizing system. We focus on the intensity of globalization as the critical economic process that explains differences in convergence and divergence in the system. The means by which the extent of globalization affects the long-run performance of economies is the geographic reach of new ideas and their conversion into innovations. The question that plays out in our model is the relative influence of globalization and the localized entrepreneurial ecology on innovation. When the globalization is weak, new firms are limited by the market value of their own city. As the globalization strengthens, more and more new firms belong to the global playground. We demonstrate that in line with empirical literature, the gross domestic product of our urban system increases greatly with the increase in globalization level.},

Data for Worcester in 1999 show that alcohol is noted as a contributory factor in 8\% of recorded crime, but that the recorded role of alcohol is far higher for certain crime types: 48\% of all harassment crimes; 36\% of violent crime and 16\% of criminal damage (other). Most recorded alcohol-related crimes occur in the city centre and at night, while at a more detailed level the main urban spaces are the city centre night-time leisure zones, and the spaces which act as routeways for the night-time revellers. The combined crime and disorder data sets, supported by interview evidence, indicate subsidiary alcohol-related daytime clusters in the shopping area and associated with specific city centre functions. By exploring the patterns, important clues to the immediate contributory factors emerge, but a more comprehensive explanation requires further research. Places, particularly in the night-time leisure zone, where alcohol-related crime is less pronounced, are as important to our understanding as those where crime/disorder is clustered. A detailed knowledge of the variety of spaces and times of alcohol-related crime and disorder is key to the development of appropriate urban design, planning and licensing policies, and can be used to inform a more closely targeted policing strategy. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Knox statistic is often used in epidemiology to test for space{\textendash}time clustering retrospectively. For quicker detection of epidemics, prospective methods should be used in which observed events in space and time are assessed as they are recorded. The cumulative sum (CUSUM) surveillance method for monitoring the local Knox statistic tests for space{\textendash}time clustering each time there is an incoming observation. We consider the design of this control chart by determining the in-control average run length (ARL) performance of the CUSUM chart for different space and time closeness thresholds as well as for different control limit values. We also explain the effect of population density and region shape on the in-control ARL and discuss other distributional issues that should be considered when implementing this method.

The authors examined all crime reported by police during the 2003 year. Methods: Using geographical information system (GIS) mapping and 2003 crime data from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the city of Madison, the authors investigated the relationships among high-density alcohol outlets and various city neighborhoods. Results: Different categories of crime showed different temporal and spatial patterns: Serious crimes peaked between 2 and 3AM, coinciding with bar closing time. Less serious crimes peaked between 11 PM and midnight. Reports of vandalism peaked in the morning and afternoon. "Hotspots" for different crimes moved throughout the downtown. Results were consistent with problems associated with high-risk student drinking in college communities. Conclusion: These results and maps generated by GIS led directly to changes made by city and university officials to address high-risk drinking. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 Heldref Publications.}

Using data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, they find evidence that econetwork extensity (the average proportion of households in the neighborhood to which a given household is tied through any location) and intensity (the degree to which household dyads are characterized by ties through multiple locations) are positively related to changes in social organization between 2000{\textendash}2001 and 2006{\textendash}2008. These findings demonstrate the relevance of econetwork characteristics{\textemdash}heretofore neglected in research on urban neighborhoods{\textemdash}for consequential dimensions of neighborhood social organization.},

  abstract = {Reproducible quantitative research is research that has been documented sufficiently rigorously that a third party can replicate any quantitative results that arise. It is argued here that such a goal is desirable for quantitative human geography, particularly as trends in this area suggest a turn towards the creation of algorithms and codes for simulation and the analysis of Big Data. A number of examples of good practice in this area are considered, spanning a time period from the late 1970s to the present day. Following this, practical aspects such as tools that enable research to be made reproducible are discussed, and some beneficial side effects of adopting the practice are identified. The paper concludes by considering some of the challenges faced by quantitative geographers aspiring to publish reproducible research.},

In a first step, we estimate sibling correlations and find a substantial influence of shared family and community background on all outcomes. To further disentangle the influence of family background and neighborhood, we estimate neighbor correlations. Our results show that for all outcomes, the estimated neighbor correlations are clearly lower than the estimated sibling correlations. However, especially for cognitive skills and mental health, neighbor correlations are still substantial in relation to sibling correlations. Thus, compared to existing results from other countries, the influence of the neighborhood on these outcomes is not negligible in Germany.},

  abstract = {"Time is our biggest worry: there is too little of it. The award winning, renowned Guardian columnist Oliver Burkeman offers a lively, entertaining philosophical guide to time and time management, setting aside superficial efficiency solutions in favour of reckoning with and finding joy in the finitude of human life. The average human lifespan is absurdly, insultingly brief. Assuming you live to be eighty, you have just over four thousand weeks. Nobody needs telling there isn't enough time. We're obsessed with our lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, work-life balance, and the ceaseless struggle against distraction; and we're deluged with advice on becoming more productive and efficient, and "lifehacks" to optimize our days. But such techniques often just end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry grows more intense, and still the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie just beyond the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management problem: the challenge of how best to use our four thousand weeks. Drawing on the insights of ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists and spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman delivers an entertaining, humorous, practical, and ultimately profound guide to time and time management. Rejecting the futile modern obsession with "getting everything done," he introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life, showing how many of the unhelpful ways we've come to think about time aren't inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we've made, as individuals and as a society--and that we could do things differently."-- Provided by publisher},

Relating open datasets to a practical model of planning reveals two major problems with currently available data. First, they are fragmented, and so multiple datasets maintained by different agencies must be consulted for a user to be able to obtain a holistic view of their risk. Second, the use of the data generally requires some expertise in data analysis. We propose that narrative policy analysis may ameliorate this problem, by presenting data (a) in amalgamated platforms that combine data of various hazards and risks; and (b) so that the user is positioned in a `resilience narrative', and their disaster risk is more readily understood.},

  abstract = {A common problem in sociology, psychology, biology, geography, and management science is the comparison of dyadic relational structures (i.e., graphs). Where these structures are formed on a common set of elements, a natural question that arises is whether there is a tendency for elements that are strongly connected in one set of structures to be more--or less--strongly connected within another set. We may ask, for instance, whether there is a correspondence between golf games and business deals, trade and warfare, or spatial proximity and genetic similarity. In each case, the data for such comparisons may be continuous or discrete, and multiple relations may be involved simultaneously (e.g., when comparing multiple measures of international trade volume with multiple types of political interactions). We propose here an exponential family of permutation models that is suitable for inferring the direction and strength of association among dyadic relational structures. A linear-time algorithm is shown for MCMC simulation of model draws, as is the use of simulated draws for maximum likelihood estimation (MCMC-MLE) and/or estimation of Monte Carlo standard errors. We also provide an easily performed maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation procedure for the permutation model family, which provides a reasonable means of generating seed models for the MCMC-MLE procedure. Use of the modeling framework is demonstrated via an application involving relationships among managers in a high-tech firm.},

Beginning with some basic simplifying assumptions, we derive a number of ways in which local network structure should be expected to vary across a region whose population is unevenly distributed. To examine the manner in which these effects would be expected to manifest given realistic population distributions, we then perform an exploratory simulation study that examines the features of large-scale interpersonal networks generated using block-level data from the 2000 U.S. Census. Using a stratified sample of micropolitan and metropolitan areas with populations ranging from approximately 1000 to 1,000,000 persons, we extrapolatively simulate network structure using spatial network models calibrated to two fairly proximate social relations. From this sample of simulated networks, we examine the effect of both within-location and between-location heterogeneity on a variety of structural properties. As we demonstrate, geographical variability produces large and distinctive features in the ``social fabric'' that overlies it; at the same time, however, many aggregate network properties can be fairly well-predicted from relatively simple spatial demographic variables. The impact of geographical variability is thus predicted to depend substantially on the type of network property being assessed, and on the spatial scale involved.},

We find that more public funds increase the economic growth of municipalities within the most impoverished region of the country (Northeast). In contrast, there is no effect in municipalities within the wealthiest region (Southeast). That is, intergovernmental transfers help regional convergence. Nonetheless, we find that the wealthiest municipalities are driving these faster growth rates in the Brazilian Northeast.

  abstract = {The widespread use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers for monitoring people, vehicles, and animals has generated large amounts of space{\textendash}time point data. One of the important analyses of such data is hot spot detection. This could be realised by first aggregating the data into a Space Time Cube (STC), and then applying statistics like Getis{\textendash}Ord Gi{${_\ast}$} or local Moran's I on the cells of the STC. Existing open-source software to realise this either focuses on the spatial aspect of the phenomenon or does not provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This paper proposes, i) a QGIS plugin, and ii) a Python package to determine the localised clusters in space and time by aggregating data into an STC. While the former provides a GUI that is easy to use, the latter is suitable for sensitivity analysis. The experiments on the openly available New York City taxi data demonstrate that the detected hot spots change depending on whether the number of passengers is used as the weight for each data point, and the statistic (i.e. Getis{\textendash}Ord Gi{${_\ast}$} or local Moran's I). The main advantages of the developed software are two-fold. First, they contribute to free and open-source software for geospatial (FOSS4G). Second, users of varying expertise can utilise them on a potpourri of use cases ranging from transportation to criminology.},

  abstract = {In this study, we examine the association between neighborhood socioeconomic ascent from 1990 to 2010 and charter school openings from 2010 to 2016 using a national sample of school attendance boundaries in the U.S. We first index school attendance boundaries into typologies according to their demographic profiles in 2010, and changes along multiple components of socioeconomic status from 1990 to 2010. We then examine whether charter schools were increasingly opening in neighborhoods that experienced SES ascent and find notable variation between different types of neighborhoods where charters expanded. When charters opened in ascendant neighborhoods, they located proportionally more often in racially and socioeconomically diverse urban areas compared to prior years. Results provide a rich descriptive portrait of the neighborhood context of recent charter expansion.},

  abstract = {Bipartite networks represent pairwise relationships between nodes belonging to two distinct classes. While established methods exist for analyzing unipartite networks, those for bipartite network analysis are somewhat obscure and relatively less developed. Community detection in such instances is frequently approached by first projecting the network onto a unipartite network, a method where edges between node classes are encoded as edges within one class. Here we test seven different projection schemes by assessing the performance of community detection on both: (i) a real-world dataset from social media and (ii) an ensemble of artificial networks with prescribed community structure. A number of performance and accuracy issues become apparent from the experimental findings, especially in the case of long-tailed degree distributions. Of the methods tested, the ``hyperbolic'' projection scheme alleviates most of these difficulties and is thus the most robust scheme of those tested. We conclude that any interpretation of community detection algorithm performance on projected networks must be done with care as certain network configurations require strong community preference for the bipartite structure to be reflected in the unipartite communities. Our results have implications for the analysis of detected community structure in projected unipartite networks.},

  abstract = {This research presents an analysis of spatial access to both opioid use disorder treatment facilities and emergency medical services in New Hampshire during 2015{\textendash}2016, a period during which there was a steep increase in unintentional overdoses involving fentanyl. For this research, spatial access was computed using the enhanced two-step floating catchment area model combined with the Huff model to assess access across New Hampshire and give attention to supply-side parameters that can impact spatial access. The model is designed to measure access to healthcare services for opioid use disorder patients offered at treatment centers or from buprenorphine treatment practitioners, as well as from emergency medical services across New Hampshire. A composite index of accessibility is proposed to represent overall access to these different treatment services for opioid use disorder patients. Geospatial determinants of spatial access included street network distances, driving times and distance decay relationships, while other key factors were services availability and population demand. Among the towns with the highest composite access scores, approximately 40\% were metropolitan locations while 16\% were rural towns. The insights from this research showed that for this period, while the opioid crisis was impacting many towns in New Hampshire, high levels of access to treatment services were not uniform across the state. When comparing the access results with data on the towns of residence for individuals who died from unintentional overdoses involving fentanyl during 2015 and 2016, estimates found that approximately 40\% of the towns were not estimated to be in the highest class of access to treatment services at the time. This research provides information for local public health officials to support planning strategies to address opioid use disorder treatment access in high-risk regions.},

  abstract = {Analyses of spatial distributions in ecology are often influenced by spatial autocorrelation. While methods to deal with spatial autocorrelation in Normally distributed data are already frequently used, the analysis of non-Normal data in the presence of spatial autocorrelation are rarely known to ecologists. Several methods based on the generalized estimating equations (GEE) are compared in their performance to a better known autoregressive method, namely spatially simultaneous autoregressive error model (SSAEM). GEE are further used to analyze the influence of autocorrelation of observations on logistic regression models. Originally, these methods were developed for longitudinal data and repeated measures models. This paper proposes some techniques for application to two-dimensional macroecological and biogeographical data sets displaying spatial autocorrelation. Results are presented for both computationally simulated data and ecological data (distribution of plant species richness throughout Germany and distribution of the plant species Hydrocotyle vulgaris). While for Normally distributed data SSAEM perform better than GEE, GEE provide far better results than frequently used autologistic regressions and remove residual spatial autocorrelation substantially when having binary data.},

The strength of co-movement is quantified using the cohesion measure developed by Croux, Forni, and Reichlin (Rev. Econ. Statist. 83 (2001) 232). The data indicate that cohesion is generally positive for the state/sector pairs, although the distributions mass around relatively low values. The results suggest that cohesion has risen over time and that cohesion increases with spatial aggregation. Evidence reveals that the measured degree of co-movement is sensitive to the chosen periodicity of the data and that there is much greater cohesion across states for a given sector than across different sectors within a state. An investigation into the sources of crossstate variation in cohesion reveals that important determinants include the share of state employment in manufacturing, the different effects of monetary policy actions on each state's employment, and the degree of sectoral diversity within a state.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the nature and scale of inter-regional and inter-urban inequalities in the UK in the context of international comparisons and our aim is to identify the extent to which such inequalities are associated with strong national economic performance. In order to do this, we first discuss the evolution of UK interregional inequalities relative to comparator European economies over more than a century. We then focus specifically on comparisons between the UK and the reunified Germany. These two exercises demonstrate that the experience of the UK has been rather different to other countries. We further explore UK inter-urban inequalities in the light of international evidence and then explain why observations of cities only tell us a partial story about the nature of interregional inequalities, especially in the case of the UK. Finally, we move onto an OECD-wide analysis of the relationships between economic growth and interregional inequality. What we observe is that any such relationships are very weak, and the only real evidence of a positive relationship is in the post-2008 crisis period, a result which points to differentials in regional resilience rather than inequality-led growth. Moreover, once former transition economies are removed from the sample, the relationship disappears, or if anything becomes slightly negative. As such, the international evidence suggests that the UK's very high spatial inequalities have hampered, rather than facilitated, national economic growth.},

Using real estate data from a large suburb in the Washington D.C. area we first show that the whole distribution of marketing time shifts to the right when a ``hot'' housing market in 2003 is compared with a ``cold'' one in 2007. The shift, however, is not homogenous across the distribution: it is negligible at lower percentiles, very large at the median and much smaller at higher percentiles. Moreover, the shift in the distribution cannot be explained by changes in the characteristics of the units. We then compute (quality adjusted) time on the market distributions and hazard functions for each year during the period 1997 to 2007. We find that while there are no changes at the bottom of the (conditional) distribution over time, higher percentiles, such as the first quartile and the median, are notably more volatile. We also find that the distribution of marketing time is heterogeneous across property types and property location. The focus on the distribution of marketing time rather than solely on the mean or on the median provides a comprehensive description of the evolution of this asset's liquidity and may help homeowners and financial institutions to better grapple with liquidity risk.},

  abstract = {"The most trusted explainer of the most mind-boggling concepts pulls back the veil of mystery that has too long cloaked the most valuable building blocks of modern science. Sean Carroll, with his genius for making complex notions entertaining, presents in his uniquely lucid voice the fundamental ideas informing the modern physics of reality. Physics offers deep insights into the workings of the universe but those insights come in the form of equations that often look like gobbledygook. Sean Carroll shows that they are really like meaningful poems that can help us fly over sierras to discover a miraculous multidimensional landscape alive with radiant giants, warped space-time, and bewilderingly powerful forces. High school calculus is itself a centuries-old marvel as worthy of our gaze as the Mona Lisa. And it may come as a surprise the extent to which all our most cutting-edge ideas about black holes are built on the math calculus enables. No one else could so smoothly guide readers to grasping the very equation Einstein used to describe his theory of general relativity. In the tradition of the legendary Richard Feynman lectures presented sixty years ago, this book is an inspiring, dazzling introduction to a way of seeing that will resonate across cultural and generational boundaries for many years to come"--},

The aim is to establish stylised facts about cycles and convergence. It appears that while the cycles are highly correlated, the two richest regions have been diverging from the others in recent years. A new model is developed in order to characterise the converging behaviour of the six poorest regions. The model combines convergence components with a common trend and cycles. These convergence components are formulated as a second-order error correction mechanism which allows temporary divergence while imposing eventual convergence. After fitting the model, the implications for forecasting are examined. Finally, the use of unit root tests for testing convergence is critically assessed in the light of the stylised facts obtained from the fitted models.},

We use data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS: 88) and combine it with U.S. Census data at the level of students' residential zip codes. These data allow us to analyze simultaneously all aspects of students' lives: their families, neighborhoods, and schools. Our findings suggest that "bringing neighborhood in" makes sense for this line of research. Disadvantages at the neighborhood and school level may place students at risk, by influencing students and their achievement in mathematics directly and indirectly. We find that both disadvantaged neighborhoods and disadvantaged schools are directly associated with lower levels of mathematics achievement, even after controlling for individual level background variables. Disadvantaged neighborhoods are also indirectly associated with students' mathematics achievement, by weakening parents' ability to help children succeed in school. Despite these difficulties, parents may be able to overcome, to some degree, neighborhood disadvantages by frequently communicating with their children, closely monitoring their activities, and providing extra learning opportunities for them.},

To prevent the union, she needs the help of her cousin Theo, who is working as a translator for the Chinese Labour Corps in the French countryside. In the town of Noyelles-sur-Mer, Camille Roussel is planning her escape from an abusive marriage, and to end a love affair that can no longer continue. When Camille offers Pauline a room for her stay, the two women become friends. But it's not long before Pauline uncovers a perilous secret that Camille has been hiding from her. As their dangerous situation escalates, the two women are forced to make a terrible decision that will bind them together for the rest of their lives. Set against the little-known history of the 140,000 Chinese workers brought to Europe as non-combatant labor during WWI, The Porcelain Moon is a tale of forbidden love, identity and belonging, and what we are willing to risk for freedom." --},

Higher rates of high-risk drinking among ethnic minorities are reported for Native Americans and Hispanics, although within-ethnic group differences (e.g., gender, age-group, and other subpopulations) also are evident for ethnicities. Whites and Native Americans have a greater risk for alcohol use disorders relative to other ethnic groups. However, once alcohol dependence occurs, Blacks and Hispanics experience higher rates than Whites of recurrent or persistent dependence. Furthermore, the consequences of drinking appear to be more profound for Native Americans, Hispanics, and Blacks. Disparities in alcohol treatment utilization are most apparent for Hispanics. Explanations for these differences are complex, likely affected by risky drinking behaviors, immigration experiences, racial/ethnic discrimination, economic and neighborhood disadvantage, and variations in alcohol-metabolizing genes. Research must maintain a systematic, strong, and growing focus on ethnic minorities. A more complete understanding of these effects for ethnic minority groups is needed to enable researchers to face the challenges of reducing and ultimately eliminating health disparities in the alcohol field.}

Methods Longitudinal data were collected from 1091 adolescents (aged 14{\textendash}16 at baseline) recruited from 50 zip codes in California with varying levels of alcohol outlet density and median household income. Hierarchical linear models were used to examine the associations between zip code alcohol outlet density and frequency rates of general alcohol use and excessive drinking, taking into account zip code median household income and individual-level variables (age, gender, race/ethnicity, personal income, mobility and perceived drinking by parents and peers). Findings When all other factors were controlled, higher initial levels of drinking and excessive drinking were observed among youths residing in zip codes with higher alcohol outlet densities. Growth in drinking and excessive drinking was, on average, more rapid in zip codes with lower alcohol outlet densities. The relation of zip code alcohol outlet density with drinking appeared to be mitigated by having friends with access to a car. Conclusion Alcohol outlet density may play a significant role in initiation of underage drinking during early teenage, especially when youths have limited mobility. Youth who reside in areas with low alcohol outlet density may overcome geographic constraints through social networks that increase their mobility and the ability to seek alcohol and drinking opportunities beyond the local community.},

However, there is a lack of systematic understanding on the spatiality of PMR from a pluralistic perspective. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the spatiality of PMR in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) using city-level data on gross domestic product (GDP), population share, and urban income growth for the period 2000{\textendash}2013. The results reveal that economically, the YRDUA is experiencing greater polycentricity, but in terms of social welfare, the region manifests growing monocentricity. We further find that the triple transition framework (marketization, urbanization, and decentralization) can greatly explain the observed patterns. Although the economic goals are accomplished with better spatial linkages and early economic development policies, inequality in spatial distribution of public services and the continuing legacy of central planning remain barriers for the YRDUA to emerge as a successful PMR. The results of this research offer meaningful insights on the impact of polycentric policies in the YRDUA and support policymakers in the implementation of appropriate urban spatial development strategies.},

Our findings from a new exploratory technique in spatial analysis show convergence in income and investment but not in human capital, which is in line with results from non-spatial classical convergence models. We confirm the investment-driven economy in China and suggest that investment mainly facilitates the convergence trend of regional income and gradually narrows the coastal-wide divide. Targeting investment and spatial connectivity in low-income regions could be a key policy direction to achieve balanced regional development.},

In particular, we analyze weighted bipartite networks that describes the relationships between actors on one side and features or traits on the other, together with the intensity level to which actors show their features. We develop a methodological approach that takes into account the underlying multivariate dependence among groups of actors. The idea is that positions in a network could be defined on the basis of the similar intensity levels that the actors exhibit in expressing some features, instead of just considering relationships that actors hold with each others. Moreover, we propose a new clustering procedure that exploits the potentiality of copula functions, a mathematical instrument for the modelization of the stochastic dependence structure. Our clustering algorithm can be applied both to binary and real-valued matrices. We validate it with simulations and applications to real-world data.},

We present new evidence on the impacts ofMTOon children's long-term outcomes using administrative data from tax returns. We find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood significantly improves college attendance rates and earnings for children who were young (below age 13) when their families moved. These children also live in better neighborhoods themselves as adults and are less likely to become single parents. The treatment effects are substantial: children whose families take up an experimental voucher to move to a lower-poverty area when they are less than 13 years old have an annual income that is \$3,477 (31\%) higher on average relative to a mean of \$11,270 in the control group in their mid-twenties. In contrast, the same moves have, if anything, negative long-term impacts on children who are more than 13 years old when their families move, perhaps because of the disruption effects of moving to a very different environment. The gains from moving fall with the age when children move, consistent with recent evidence that the duration of exposure to a better environment during childhood is a key determinant of an individual's long-term outcomes. The findings imply that offering vouchers to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods to families with young children who are living in high- poverty housing projects may reduce the intergenerational persistence of poverty and ultimately generate positive returns for taxpayers.},

In the first part, we present quasi-experimental evidence that neighborhoods affect intergenerational mobility through childhood exposure effects. In partic-ular, the outcomes of children whose families move to a better neighborhood {\textendash} as measured by the outcomes of children already living there {\textendash} improve linearly in proportion to the time they spend growing up in that area. We distinguish the causal effects of neighborhoods from con-founding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within families, studying moves triggered by displacement shocks, and exploiting sharp variation in predicted place effects across birth cohorts, genders, and quantiles. We also document analogous childhood exposure e{$\carriagereturn$}ects for college attendance, teenage birth rates, and marriage rates. In the second part of the paper, we identify the causal effect of growing up in every county in the U.S. by estimating a fixed effects model identified from families who move across counties with children of di{$\carriagereturn$}erent ages. We use these estimates to decompose observed intergenerational mobility into a causal and sorting com-ponent in each county. For children growing up in families at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, each year of childhood exposure to a one standard deviation (SD) better county increases income in adulthood by 0.5\%. Hence, growing up in a one SD better county from birth increases a child's income by approximately 10\%. Low-income children are most likely to succeed in counties that have less concentrated poverty, less income inequality, better schools, a larger share of two-parent families, and lower crime rates. Boys' outcomes vary more across areas than girls, and boys have especially poor outcomes in highly-segregated areas. In urban areas, better areas have higher house prices, but our analysis uncovers significant variation in neighborhood quality even conditional on prices.}

For each tract, we estimate children's earnings distributions, incarceration rates, and other out-comes in adulthood by parental income, race, and gender. Children's outcomes vary sharply across nearby areas: for children with parents at the 25th percentile of the national income distribution, the standard deviation of mean household income at age 35 is \$5,000 across tracts within counties. We illustrate how the tract-level data provide insight into how neighborhoods shape the development of human capital and support local economic policy using two applications. First, we show how these data can be used to better target policies to improve economic opportunity by uncovering specific neighborhoods where certain subgroups of children grow up to have poor outcomes. Neighborhoods matter at a very granular level: conditional on characteristics such as poverty rates in a child's own Census tract, characteristics of tracts that are one mile away have little predictive power for a child's outcomes. Second, we show that the observational estimates are highly predictive of neighborhoods' causal effects, based on a comparison to data from the Moving to Opportunity experiment and a quasi-experimental research design analyzing movers' outcomes. We then identify high-opportunity neighborhoods that are affordable to low-income families, information that can be used to design affordable housing policies. Our measures of children's long-term outcomes are only weakly correlated with traditional proxies for local economic success such as rates of job growth, showing that the conditions that create greater upward mobility are not necessarily the same as those that lead to productive labor markets.},

  abstract = {We construct a public atlas of children's outcomes in adulthood by the Census tract in which they grew up using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population. For each tract, we estimate children's earnings distributions, incarceration rates, and other outcomes in adulthood by parental income, race, and gender. Children's outcomes vary sharply across nearby areas: for children with parents at the 25th percentile of the national income distribution, the standard deviation of mean household income at age 35 is \$5,000 across tracts within counties. We illustrate how the tract-level data provide insight into how neighborhoods shape the development of human capital and support local economic policy using two applications. First, we show how these data can be used to better target policies to improve economic opportunity by uncovering specific neighborhoods where certain subgroups of children grow up to have poor outcomes. Neighborhoods matter at a very granular level: conditional on characteristics such as poverty rates in a child's own Census tract, characteristics of tracts that are one mile away have little predictive power for a child's outcomes. Second, we show that the observational estimates are highly predictive of neighborhoods' causal effects, based on a comparison to data from the Moving to Opportunity experiment and a quasi-experimental research design analyzing movers' outcomes. We then identify high-opportunity neighborhoods that are affordable to low-income families, information that can be used to design affordable housing policies. Our measures of children's long-term outcomes are only weakly correlated with traditional proxies for local economic success such as rates of job growth, showing that the conditions that create greater upward mobility are not necessarily the same as those that lead to productive labor markets.},

  abstract = {Abstract We study the sources of racial disparities in income using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989 to 2015. We document three results. First, black Americans and American Indians have much lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to persistent disparities across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven by differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Hispanic Americans have rates of intergenerational mobility more similar to whites than blacks, leading the Hispanic-white income gap to shrink across generations. Second, differences in parental marital status, education, and wealth explain little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99\% of Census tracts. The few areas with small black-white gaps tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks. Black males who move to such neighborhoods earlier in childhood have significantly better outcomes. However, less than 5\% of black children grow up in such areas. Our findings suggest that reducing the black-white income gap will require efforts whose impacts cross neighborhood and class lines and increase upward mobility specifically for black men.},

In the UK, research on house price variation has been hindered by a lack of extensive data linking the prices of properties at different places and times to their physical attributes. This paper addresses this gap through using a new dataset linking Land Registry Price Paid Data to attribute data from Ordnance Survey and Energy Performance Certificates datasets. The new data are used to investigate spatial disparities in England's house prices at four geographical scales (from local authority to individual address) between 2009 and 2016 {\textendash} a period of sustained price rises after the global financial crisis of 2008. We selected two housing price measures for comparison, namely transaction price and the house price per square metre. Multilevel variance components models are used to estimate variation in the two house price measures at four different spatial scales and we compare spatial disparities in the two measures at these different scales. Our results suggest that accounting for the size of properties by using house price per square metre offers a more accurate picture of house price variation than does the use of transaction prices at the same geographic scale. Spatial disparities in house price per square metre are more apparent and are seen to be clustered at local authority level and highly clustered at Middle Layer Super Output Area level, with imbalances increasing during this eight-year period and highlighting the strong and growing influence of London on the national housing market.},

  abstract = {A significant challenge in handling geographic datasets is that the datasets can come from heterogeneous sources with various data qualities and formats. Before these datasets can be used in a Geographic Information System (GIS) for spatial analysis or to create maps, a typical task is to clean the attribute data and transform the data into a uniform format. However, conventional GIS products focus on manipulating the spatial component of geographic features and only offer basic tools for editing the attribute data (e.g., one row at a time). This limits the capability for handling large datasets in a GIS since manually editing and transforming attribute data between different formats is not practical for thousands of geographic features. In this demo, we present ArcKarma, which is built on our previous work on data transformation, to efficiently clean and transform data attributes in a GIS. ArcKarma generates transformation programs from a few user-provided examples and applies these programs to transform individual attribute columns into the desired formats. We show that ArcKarma produces accurate results and eliminates the need for laborious manual data cleaning and scripting tasks.},

  abstract = {Background: Elements of the physical environment have been shown to influence health behaviors including drug use and overdose mortality. Throughout the opioid epidemic in the United States, rural regions have been disproportionately affected by opioid overdose. Although the relationship between the urban built environment and opioid overdose has been established, little is known as to how trends may differ in rural areas. Methods: Risk terrain modeling was used as a spatial analytical approach to assess environmental features that significantly increase the risk of opioid overdose in Jefferson County, Alabama. Spatial risk assessments were conducted for urban and rural regions as well as for the county as a whole. Criminogenic, opioidrelated, and community variables were included and compared across spatial risk models. Results: The geographic context, rural or urban, influenced the relationship between environmental features and opioid overdose. In rural areas, community features such as bus stops and public schools were related to the occurrence of opioid overdose. In urban areas, inpatient treatment centers, transitional living facilities, express loan establishments, and liquor vendors were significantly related to the locations of opioid overdose. Conclusion: Risk terrain modeling can be used to locate high-risk areas for opioid overdose while identifying factors that are contributing to the risk of events occurring in communities. The patterns of overdose risk differ in rural and urban contexts and may be used to inform the placement of treatment and prevention resources.},

City blocks on which a rodent bite case had been reported (n=415) and three control blocks per bite block, matched by borough and randomly selected, were compared according to demographic characteristics obtained from US Census data. Environmental variable were defined using a geographic information system to extract distances to areas potentially providing food or refuge for rats, such as parks. Borough-specific models of bite risk were generated by logistic regression using data collected from 1991 to 1994; risk values were then generated for all city blocks. Field surveys for signs of rat infestation conducted on 31 randomly selected blocks indicated a significant association betwen degree of infestation and predicted risk. Spatial analyses comparing neighboring blocks showed that bolcks with bite ccases were significantly clustered. The models based on data from previous years correctly predicted 72 percent of 53 block addresses of rodent bite cases from 1995 as being location of high or intermediate risk. A combination of geographic and edidemiologic analyses could help investigators identify the spatial occurrence of rat infestation over a large area and might help to focus control activities.

  abstract = {The estimation of income distributions is important for assessing income inequality and poverty and for making comparisons of inequality and poverty over time, countries and regions, as well as before and after changes in taxation and transfer policies. Distributions have been estimated both parametrically and non-parametrically. Parametric estimation is convenient because it facilitates subsequent inferences about inequality and poverty measures and lends itself to further analysis such as the combining of regional distributions into a national distribution. Non-parametric estimation makes inferences more difficult, but it does not place what are sometimes unreasonable restrictions on the nature of the distribution. By estimating a mixture of gamma distributions, in this paper we attempt to benefit from the advantages of parametric estimation without suffering the disadvantage of inflexibility. Using a sample of Canadian income data, we use Bayesian inference to estimate gamma mixtures with two and three components. We describe how to obtain a predictive density and distribution function for income and illustrate the flexibility of the mixture. Posterior densities for Lorenz curve ordinates and the Gini coefficient are obtained.},

He argued that his model did not need to include terms for faraway places like Singapore, while still being relative accurate in his forecast by invoking what he called the first law of geography. In spatial optimization, like the general warehouse location problem (GWLP), it is assumed that all possible linkages need to be included, as arbitrarily dropping potential variables may prevent optimal solutions from being identified. In this article, it is demonstrated that it may be possible to meet such exacting standards in spatial optimization, while at the same time being guided by Tobler's argument for being simple and frugal. This article gives a demonstration of how this might be achieved using the GWLP as an example. A new model form is proposed which distinguishes between ``near'' (low cost) allocations and ``far'' (high cost) allocations and uses both explicit and implicit variables for capacity allocations. Computational experience in using this new model is given which shows that optimal solutions can be identified and verified while eliminating a substantial number of allocation/transport variables and constraints. This article ends with a challenge for the reformulation and redevelopment of other spatial optimization problems in regional science.},

We broadly replicate a previous study of matching and ask to what extent households live in communities that are similar in socio-economic status to their characteristics. And, when households move, do they relocate in such a way as to increase similarity to their neighbours? The processes are at the heart of understanding the urban structure, how it changes over time and the links to urban inequality. The article uses data on household incomes from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamic (HILDA) Survey to measure the degree of similarity between households and their neighbours. We study the variation in matching for the population as a whole, and by quintiles of median neighbourhood income. We also measure how individuals that change neighbourhoods increase their similarity to the destination neighbourhood. We find that with respect to matching there is considerable diversity in the levels of matching; and that with respect to residential change, households in general do not make major shifts to increase matching when we control for housing tenure and other household characteristics. There is a need for further replications to understand the nature of matching and the outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background Existing research has found a positive association between cognitive function and residence in a socioeconomically advantaged neighbourhood. Yet, the mechanisms underlying this relationship have not been empirically investigated. Objective To test the hypothesis that neighbourhood socioeconomic structure is related to cognitive function partly through the availability of neighbourhood physical and social resources (eg, recreational facilities, community centres and libraries), which promote cognitively beneficial activities such as exercise and social integration. Methods Using data from a representative survey of community-dwelling adults in the city of Chicago (N=949 adults aged 50 and over), cognitive function was assessed with a modified version of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status instrument. Neighbourhood socioeconomic structure was derived from US census indicators. Systematic social observation was used to directly document the presence of neighbourhood resources on the blocks surrounding each respondent's residence. Results Using multilevel linear regression, residence in an affluent neighbourhood had a net positive effect on cognitive function after adjusting for individual risk factors. For white respondents, the effects of neighbourhood affluence operated in part through a greater density of institutional resources (eg, community centres) that promote cognitively beneficial activities such as physical activity. Stable residence in an elderly neighbourhood was associated with higher cognitive function (potentially due to greater opportunities for social interaction with peers), but long term exposure to such neighbourhoods was negatively related to cognition. Conclusions Neighbourhood resources have the potential to promote `cognitive reserve' for adults who are ageing in place in an urban setting.},

A greater density of physical resources (e.g., recreational centers and parks) and institutional resources (e.g., community centers) may buffer cognitive decline by offering opportunities for physical activity and social interaction. Methods Using data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (1993{\textendash}2011), a prospective cohort study of 6518 adults of age 65 years or older, we fit a three-level growth curve model to examine the role of individual and neighborhood factors (objectively observed at the block group level) on trajectories of cognitive function (composite of East Boston Memory Test, symbol digit test, and Mini Mental State Examination) in later life. Results Net of individual factors, residence in a neighborhood with community resources, proximity to public transit, and public spaces in good condition were associated with slower rates of cognitive decline, possibly by increasing opportunities for social and physical activities or access to destinations that facilitate engagement in activities. Conclusions These results highlight the role of neighborhood environments in buffering cognitive decline among older adults aging in place.},

Such maps usually display either relative rates in each district, as measured by a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) or some similar index, or the statistical significance level for a test of the difference between the rates in that district and elsewhere. Neither of these approaches is fully satisfactory and we propose a new approach using empirical Bayes estimation. The resulting estimators represent a weighted compromise between the SMR, the overall mean relative rate, and a local mean of the relative rate in nearby areas. The compromise solution depends on the reliability of each individual SMR and on estimates of the overall amount of dispersion of relative rates over different districts.},

This fault is not just a minor academic quibble: it underlies a reproducibility crisis now threatening entire disciplines. In an increasingly data-reliant culture, this same deeply rooted error shapes decisions in medicine, law, and public policy with profound consequences. The foundation of the problem is a misunderstanding of probability and our ability to make inferences from data. Aubrey Clayton traces the history of how statistics went astray, beginning with the groundbreaking work of the seventeenth-century mathematician Jacob Bernoulli and winding through gambling, astronomy, and genetics. He recounts the feuds among rival schools of statistics, exploring the surprisingly human problems that gave rise to the discipline and the all-too-human shortcomings that derailed it. Clayton highlights how influential nineteenth- and twentieth-century figures developed a statistical methodology they claimed was purely objective in order to silence critics of their political agendas, including eugenics. Clayton provides a clear account of the mathematics and logic of probability, conveying complex concepts accessibly for readers interested in the statistical methods that frame our understanding of the world. He contends that we need to take a Bayesian approach-incorporating prior knowledge when reasoning with incomplete information-in order to resolve the crisis. Ranging across math, philosophy, and culture, Bernoulli's Fallacy explains why something has gone wrong with how we use data-and how to fix it"--},

The concept was that higher socioeconomic status helped some people to avoid risks and adopt protective strategies using flexible resources: knowledge, money, power, prestige, and beneficial social connections. As a sociological theory, FCT addressed this issue by calling on social stratification, stigma, and racism as they affected medical treatments and health outcomes. The last comprehensive review was completed a decade ago. Since then, FCT has been tested, and new applications have extended central features. The current review consolidates key foci in the literature in order to guide future research in the field. Notable themes emerged around types of resources and their usage, approaches used to test the theory, and novel extensions. We conclude that after 25 years of use, there remain crucial questions to be addressed.},

  abstract = {Geodemographics conventionally refers to the classification of geographical areas based on the socioeconomic characteristics of their residents. In this paper, we develop the novel concept of a classification based on the characteristics of workers and workplaces. The paper describes the implementation of this concept at the small area level for the whole of the UK, which has involved reconciliation of three slightly different national censuses. It presents a summary of the resulting classification (a Classification of Workplace Zones for the UK (COWZ-UK)) and an innovative validation exercise based on comparison with a very large digital mapping dataset containing specific workplace locations. The openly available classification provides important new insights into the characteristics of workers and workplaces at the small area level across the UK, which will be useful for analysts in a range of sectors, including health, local government, transport and commerce. The generic concept of a classification based on the characteristics of workers and workplaces within a set of workplace zones is transferable to other countries, with refinement to reflect context- and country-specific phenomena. The concept can be readily implemented by census agencies or other data providers where individual level worker and workplace data are available.},

  abstract = {Population data are traditionally obtained through censuses and aggregated up to the level of administrative units for reasons of privacy. This way, however, detailed information on the spatial distribution of the population within these units is masked. Dasymetric mapping techniques were developed to disaggregate population to a finer spatial level using ancillary data. However, a frequently recurring problem in dasymetric mapping studies relates to the overestimation of low-population-density areas and the underestimation of high-population-density areas. To tackle this issue, this research proposes a novel dasymetric mapping approach explicitly dealing with spatial non-stationarity. For this purpose, a comparative model building framework was set up. The impact of spatial non-stationarity on model performance was investigated by comparing global (OLS), regional (rule-based) and local (geographically weighted) regression. Also, the impact of model complexity was considered through stepwise inclusion of information on address type and location, household size and demographic and residential characteristics in the dasymetric model. The approach was tested in the highly complex environment of the FlanderseBrussels region. It was found that the regional model that incorporates address type and household size information performs best and overcomes the structural over- and underestimation issue in dasymetric mapping.},

It groups these into those that use ancillary data to constrain or guide the interpolation (dasymetric, statistical, street-weighted, and point-based), and those do not but instead develop and refine allocation procedures (area to point, pycnophylactic, and areal weighting). Each approach is illustrated by being applied to the same case study. The analysis is extended to examine the opportunities arising from the many new forms of spatial data that are generated by everyday activities such as social media, check-ins, websites offering services, microblogging sites, and social sensing, as well as intentional VGI activities, both supported by ubiquitous web- and GPS-enabled technologies. Here, data of residential properties from a commercial website was used as ancillary data. Overall, the interpolations using many of the new forms of data perform as well as traditional, formal data, highlighting the analytical opportunities as ancillary information for spatial interpolation, and for supporting spatial analysis more generally. However, the case study also highlighted the need to consider the completeness and representativeness of such data. The R code used to generate the data, to develop the analysis and to create the tables and figures is provided.},

  abstract = {The perceived quality of urban environments is intrinsically tied to the availability of desirable leisure and retail opportunities. In this article, we explore methodological approaches for deriving indicators that estimate the willingness to pay for retail and leisure services offered by retail centers. Most often, because the quality of urban environments cannot be qualified by a natural unit, the willingness to pay for an urban environment is explored through the lens of the residential housing market. Traditional approaches control for individual characteristics of houses, meaning that the remaining variation in the price can be unpacked and related to the availability of local amenities or, equivalently, the willingness to pay. In this article, we use similar motivations but exchange housing prices for residential properties with property taxes paid by nondomestic properties to glean hierarchies of retail centers. We outline the applied methodological steps that include very recent, nontrivial contributions from the literature to estimate these hierarchies and provide clear instructions for reproducing the methodology. Using the case study of England and Wales, we undertake a series of econometric experiments to rigorously assess retail center willingness to pay (RWTP) as a test of the methods reviewed. We build intuition toward our preferred specification, a Bayesian multilevel model, that accounts for the possibility of a spatial autoregressive process. Overall, the applied methodology describes a blueprint for building hierarchies of retail spaces and addresses the limited availability of spatial data that measure the economic and social value of retail centers. Key Words: econometrics, retail geography, spatial statistics.}

There are considerable international differences in levels of drug death rates and substance abuse. However, there are also considerable variations within countries in drug misuse, overdose rates, and in drug death rates particularly. Wide intra-national variations characterize countries where drug deaths have risen fastest in recent years, such as the US and UK. Drug deaths are an outcome of drug misuse, which can ideally be studied at a relatively low spatial scale (e.g., US counties). The research literature suggests that small area variations in drug deaths to a considerable degree reflect contextual (place-related) factors as well as individual risk factors. We consider the role of area social status, social cohesion, segregation, urbanicity, and drug supply in an ecological regression analysis of county differences in drug deaths in the US during 2015-2017. The analysis of US small area data highlights a range of factors which are statistically significant in explaining differences in drug deaths, but with no risk factor having a predominant role. Comparisons with other countries where small area drug mortality data have been analyzed show differences between countries in the impact of different contextual factors, but some common themes. Intra-national differences in drug-related deaths are considerable, but there are significant research gaps in the evidence base for small area analysis of such deaths.},

Despite this urgent conservation need, landscape management typically focuses on single species and rarely includes the influence of disturbance-dependent vegetation transitions on multiple target species. In this paper, we describe a simulation model that achieves these goals, ranking possible fire management strategies from the viewpoint of protecting endangered coastal Southern Californian wildlife. The model involves the direct and indirect effects of fire on four animal species of conservation concern (coastal cactus wren, California gnatcatcher, Stephens' kangaroo rat, and Pacific pocket mouse) and five vegetation types (grass, coastal sage scrub, obligate seeding and resprouting chaparral, resprouting-only chaparral, and woodlands). Using historical fire records for the region, we predicted spatially-explicit fire frequencies and ignition probabilities. For these predictions, we simulated the location and extent of fires. Combining fire history and vegetation transition data from 1933 to 2003, we specified vegetation change probabilities under simulated fire regimes. Fire occurrence in a location altered habitat suitability, directly for each of the animal species and indirectly by changing the vegetative community. For some open-habitat species, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and Pacific pocket mouse, fairly frequent fire is required to reduce the density of invasive grasses and herbs. For other species, such as the coastal cactus wren and California gnatcatcher, frequent fire destroys the mature coastal sage scrub on which these species depend. The model includes a management component, allowing us to rank fire management actions. Over a 50-year time horizon, we find that populations of California gnatcatchers and Pacific pocket mouse are highly variable, and the pocket mouse is particularly prone to decline, despite prescribed burns designed to boost population viability. California gnatcatchers were also likely to be extirpated in the model, with relatively small extirpation risks for the cactus wren and Stephens' kangaroo rat. Despite conflicting requirements with respect to fire and differing life history traits among the four animals, we identified a beneficial strategy for our four target species, namely, controlling fire in coastal sage scrub.},

Data from licensed alcohol outlets and violent crime events that occurred between 2005 and 2011 were analyzed using global and local bivariate space-time k-function analyses. The global bivariate space-time K-function analyses indicated that there was dispersion between bars and crime over space and time. Personal crimes showed both dispersion and clustering. Local analyses revealed clustering between alcohol outlets and crimes at discrete space-time intervals. Spatio-temporal analysis of the association between bars and crime gives an indication of the direction of the relationship between them. If this dynamic is better understood, it could be better regulated.}

Nine complementary indicators are calculated for each Census Division using administrative data on a cohort of men and women born between 1963 and 1970. Collectively these indicators underscore the importance of simultaneously examining different dimensions of intergenerational mobility and also show that higher mobility is most strongly associated with less income inequality in the bottom half of the income distribution.},

As Oklahoma City's first four-term mayor, Mick Cornett has used a bold, creative, and personal approach to orchestrate his city's renaissance--a crucial (and untold) story of urban reinvention. Once regarded as a "flyover city," Oklahoma City has become one of our nation's most dynamic places--and it is not alone. Indianapolis, Charleston, Seattle, Austin, New Orleans, Des Moines, Sacramento, Louisville, Buffalo: These cities are reinventing themselves and setting examples for communities of every kind--in ways that America's largest cities can't afford to do or can't figure out how to do. With The Next American City, Mayor Cornett translates his city's success into a vision for the future. Cities of modest size but outsized accomplishment, powered by a can-do spirit, valuing compromise over confrontation and progress over political victory--these are the cities leading America. and they're not waiting around for Washington's help. As Mayor Cornett argues, "In the fight to grow jobs, improve health, eradicate poverty, and protect the environment, the middle is leading the way.""--},

  abstract = {Spatial econometrics has been criticized by some economists because some model specifications have been driven by data-analytic considerations rather than having a firm foundation in economic theory. In particular, this applies to the so-called W matrix, which is integral to the structure of endogenous and exogenous spatial lags, and to spatial error processes, and which are almost the sine qua non of spatial econometrics. Moreover, it has been suggested that the significance of a spatially lagged dependent variable involving W may be misleading, since it may be simply picking up the effects of omitted spatially dependent variables, incorrectly suggesting the existence of a spillover mechanism. In this paper, we review the theoretical and empirical rationale for network dependence and spatial externalities as embodied in spatially lagged variables, arguing that failing to acknowledge their presence at least leads to biased inference, can be a cause of inconsistent estimation, and leads to an incorrect understanding of true causal processes.},

In the medium run, we find suggestive evidence that, if anything, NPIs are associated with better economic outcomes. Our findings indicate that NPIs can reduce disease transmission without necessarily further depressing economic activity.},

The research examines the influence alcohol outlet density (measured both as the density of package-only sources and of taverns) has on the level of robbery and assault. Previous research has found alcohol availability to be predictive of violence, but ecological studies have had methodological limitations, particularly the problem of spatial autocorrelation. We avoid this problem by utilizing the Maximum Likelihood Estimation technique. The results indicate, net of the effects of control variables and of the effects of spatial autocorrelation, that the density of package-only outlets significantly increases the rate of arrest for both crimes. However, the density of taverns has no such effect. A control/routine-activities interpretation of the findings is offered. {\textcopyright} 2001, Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.}

For decades, scientists have been sounding the alarm about the urgency of addressing climate change, but it took COVID-19 to demonstrate clearly that the future of human life on Earth is interconnected and at risk. While the virus quickly spread across the globe, extreme weather events compounded the suffering and economic catastrophe. In the U.S., public demonstrations of outrage over the murder of George Floyd expanded to include a growing awareness of the pandemic's disproportionate impact on communities of color. In cities around the world, people took to the streets to protest racial inequity in all of its forms. In The Path to a Livable Future, Stan Cox makes plain the connections between the multiple crises facing us today, and provides an inspired vision for how to resolve them. With a deeply informed, clear to-do list, Cox shows us how we can work together to address the climate emergency, white supremacy, and our vulnerability to future pandemics all at once. Our future depends on it"--},

  abstract = {There has so far been little discussion of the ethics of geographic information systems (GIS), yet they are complex and driven by conflicting goals. This paper argues for an ethical analysis of GIS which goes beyond "intemalist" judgements of good behavior and adherence to accuracy standards to a contextualized "extemalist" one. Only when spatial technologies such as GIS are understood as part of a nexus of relations which includes academia in the commodification of information can GIS practice by fully analyzed. A four-stage sequence of ethical practice is proposed, in which GIS has achieved the second stage. GIS practice and use is a fluctuating, contested area, which, therefore, is not suited to a rigid code of ethics. A better approach is based in the internalist and externalist dialectic.},

LQs as decision aids are typically understood through the use of arbitrarily set cut-off values. However, LQs are rarely accompanied by an associated level of variance that can be connected with the estimated data used to calculate them. This paper reveals the importance of understanding this variance and shows how confidence intervals can be estimated for employment-based LQs. A systematic process is introduced, through which the arbitrariness of cut-off-value choice can be mitigated and borderline industry cases in terms of their LQ values and the considered cut-off value, identified. A case from a UK region is used to illustrate the issues covered in the paper.},

This article employs a ?post hoc? testing approach to isolate the impact of a particular variable (transit proximity)?and supplemental diagnostics (such as partial dependence plots and permutation importances)?to help inform explanatory relationships. The results indicate that random forest models slightly outperform spatial econometric models, and the inclusion of spatial lag parameters modestly improves random forest model accuracy?the best-fit spatial random forest model demonstrates 84.61\% accuracy in predicting post-construction employment density around newly built transit stations, compared to 81.88\% for the best-fit spatial econometric model and 84.37\% for the nonspatial random forest model. However, given these somewhat small differences, it is not possible to conclude that the random forest approach is clearly superior to traditional spatial econometric models from these results alone.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} There is a strong spatial correlation between demographics and chronic diseases in urban areas. Thus, most of the public policies aimed at improving prevention plans and optimizing the allocation of resources in health networks should be designed specifically for the socioeconomic reality of the population. One way to tackle this challenge is by exploring within a small geographical area the spatial patterns that link the sociodemographic attributes that characterize a community, its risk of suffering chronic diseases, and the accessibility of health treatment. Due to the inherent complexity of cities, soft clustering methods are recommended to find fuzzy spatial patterns. Our main motivation is to provide health planners with valuable spatial information to support decision-making. For the case study, we chose to investigate diabetes in Santiago, Chile. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} To deal with spatiality, we combine two statistical techniques: spatial microsimulation and a self-organizing map (SOM). Spatial microsimulation allows spatial disaggregation of health indicators data to a small area level. In turn, SOM, unlike classical clustering methods, incorporates a learning component through neural networks, which makes it more appropriate to model complex adaptive systems, such as cities. Thus, while spatial microsimulation generates the data for the analysis, the SOM method finds the relevant socio-economic clusters. We selected age, sex, income, prevalence of diabetes, distance to public health services, and type of health insurance as input variables. We used public surveys as input data. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We found four significant spatial clusters representing 75 percent of the whole population in Santiago. Two clusters correspond to people with low educational levels, low income, high accessibility to public health services, and a high prevalence of diabetes. However, one presents a significantly higher level of diabetes than the other. The second pair of clusters is made up of people with high educational levels, high income, and low prevalence of diabetes. What differentiates both clusters is accessibility to health centers. The average distance to the health centers of one group almost doubles that of the other. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} In this study, we combined two statistical techniques: spatial microsimulation and selforganising maps to explore the relationship between diabetes and socio-demographics in Santiago, Chile. The results have allowed us to corroborate the importance of the spatial factor in the analysis of chronic diseases as a way of suggesting differentiated solutions to spatially explicit problems. SOM turned out to be a good choice to deal with fuzzy health and},

We estimate local Gini coefficients by disaggregating the traditional Lorenz curve approach at small census areas using spatial microsimulation techniques. As our case study, we chose the city of Santiago, Chile. Despite being ranked as a high-income country by the World Bank, Chile is the most unequal OECD country and the seventh worst in the world. Results reveal interesting spatial patterns that relate income inequality to income and educational level. For instance, the most unequal areas of the city correspond, perhaps against all odds, to the most well-off neighbourhoods having, in addition, the highest educational level. This result suggests that from a certain level of high income in areas with high-income inequality, the spatial cohesion of neighbourhoods may be mainly caused by the educational level of households. Results also reveal that the least unequal areas are mostly observed across neighbourhoods with low educational levels and low per capita incomes.},

The approach uses two graphs in the cumulative frequency legend to highlight the difference between the raw count of the health events and the raw count of the social characteristic like low income in the geographical areas of the map. The approach is applied to mapping publicly available data on low birth weight by town in Connecticut and Lyme disease incidence by town in Connecticut in relation to income.

Common patterns of variation in these indices across metropolitan areas are discerned using correlation and factor analyses. We find that: (1) seven principal components best summarize the dimensions of housing and employment land uses, (2) metro areas often exhibit both high and low levels of sprawl-like patterns across the seven components, and (3) housing and employment aspects of sprawl-like patterns differ in nature. Thus, land use patterns prove multi-dimensional in both theory and practice. Exploratory analyses indicate: (1) little regional variation in land use patterns, (2) metro areas with larger populations are more dense/continuous with greater housing centrality and concentration of employment in the core, (3) older areas have higher degrees of housing concentration and employment in the core, (4) constrained areas evince greater density/continuity, and (5) inter-metropolitan variations in several dimensions of land use patterns are not well explained by population, age, growth patterns, or topographical constraints on development. Results imply that policymakers must carefully unravel which land use dimension is causing undesirable outcomes, and then devise precise policy instruments to change only this dimension.},

The method is based on selecting controls from the population at risk and computing interpoint distances for the combined sample. Nonparametric tests are developed which are based on the number of cases among the k nearest neighbours of each case and the number of cases nearer than the k nearest control. The performance of these tests is evaluated analytically and by simulation and the method is applied to a data set on the locations of cases of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma in a defined geographical area. In particular the impact on power of the choice of k and of the ratio of cases to controls is examined. Modifications of the procedure to study distances from predefined objects, to match for known risk factors which would produce unwanted clustering and issues related to estimation are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Study region The Zhengzhou City in China Study focus Urban flood risk mitigation (UFRM) refers to the runoff retention capacity of land surface in urban regions. Previous studies have focused on assessing the UFRM change in central urban areas. Nevertheless, analysis of the UFRM change considering the heterogeneity of urban and rural gradient is scarce. This study aims to evaluate the spatiotemporal change of UFRM and its influencing factors in different urban functional zones. An integrated framework combining the hydrological model and geographic information system (GIS) has been established to assess the evolution of UFRM in Zhengzhou between 2000 and 2020. New hydrological insights for the region The findings illustrate the following: (1) The UFRM of Zhengzhou experienced a 10.76\% increase from 2000 to 2010, followed by a subsequent 3.38\% decrease from 2010 to 2020.(2) UFRM increased in ecological areas while decreasing in urban regions, revealing a disparity between UFRM supply and demand. (3) The adverse impact of impervious surfaces on UFRM surpasses the influence of precipitation intensity in urban regions. As a result, this study suggests that urban areas should avoid extensive expansion of impervious surfaces and prioritize implementing low-impact development practices. The ecological zones should implement rigorous policies to protect natural preservation. These findings provide policymakers a scientific foundation for devising sustainable urban development strategies to enhance urban flood resilience.},

The models are illustrated by an empirical example from a study of the role of social networks in understanding spatial clustering in unemployment in Australia. The analysis suggests that a spatial effect cannot solely explain the emergence of organised network structure and it is necessary to include both spatial and endogenous network effects in the model.},

  abstract = {Background A variety of legal, social and logistical factors can prevent individuals from accessing formal needle exchange programmes. One common solution to this problem is satellite exchange, which involves collaborating with people who already use an exchange to deliver needles and other supplies to those unable to access the exchange. While this approach can be very successful, one potential problem is that those most willing to deliver needles to their peers are often members of social networks that are already well connected with the needle exchange, leading to duplication of effort. In this paper we describe a simple and novel method for identifying groups of people who are demonstrably in need of improved access to needles, and for re-targeting efforts to meet the needs of those people. The method described was piloted at the Homeless Youth Alliance, San Francisco, USA, and further refined at Clean Needles Now, Los Angeles, USA. Methods People accessing needle exchange sites were asked to participate in a survey with two questions: ``where were you and what time was it last time someone borrowed a needle from you?'' and ``where were you and what time was it last time you had to borrow a needle from someone else?'' Responses were geocoded, and maps produced showing `hotspots' where people were frequently finding themselves without needles. Results Satellite needle exchange was refined from an ad-hoc activity into one which focused on delivering needles to those with empirically demonstrable need. Maps produced in the process also proved valuable in discussions with local officials and other agencies about funding, as well as needle provision policy and practices. Conclusion We describe a method for rapidly assessing, describing, and responding to unmet and under-met need among injecting drug users. The method is particularly well-suited to organizations with extremely limited resources.},

Advancing this nascent field first requires a way of identifying social frontiers in a robust way. Such frontiers may be `open' -- an area may contrast sharply with a neighbourhood in one direction, but blend smoothly into adjacent neighbourhoods in other directions. This poses some formidable methodological challenges, particularly when computing inference for the existence of a social frontier, an important goal if one is to distinguish true frontiers from random variation. We develop a new approach using Bayesian spatial statistical methods that permit asymmetries in spatial effects and allow for spatial autocorrelation in the data. We illustrate our method using data on Sheffield and find clear evidence of `open' frontiers. Permutations tests and Poisson regressions with fixed effects reveal compelling evidence that social frontiers are associated with higher rates of crime.},

  abstract = {There is a vast amount of literature regarding the asymptotic properties of various approaches to estimating simultaneous space{\textendash}time panel models, but little attention has been paid to how the model estimates should be interpreted. The motivation for the use of space{\textendash}time panel models is that they can provide us with information not available from cross-sectional spatial regressions. LeSage and Pace (2009) [7] showed that cross-sectional simultaneous spatial autoregressive models can be viewed as a limiting outcome of a dynamic space{\textendash}time autoregressive process. A valuable aspect of dynamic space{\textendash}time panel data models is that the ownand cross-partial derivatives that relate changes in the explanatory variables to those that arise in the dependent variables are explicit. This allows us to employ parameter estimates from these models to quantify dynamic responses over time and space as well as space{\textendash}time diffusion impacts. We illustrate our approach using the demand for cigarettes over a 30 year period from 1963{\textendash}1992, where the motivation for spatial dependence is a bootlegging effect where buyers of cigarettes near state borders purchase in neighboring states if there is a price advantage to doing so.},

  abstract = {The exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) process refers to the use of various functions to gain an initial understanding of a spatial dataset. These include measures of spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. Currently, the ESDA process is repetitive and time-consuming. Additionally, while different results arise for different datasets, how these results are generated does not change significantly. Results are also generated individually for each variable which means that they cannot be easily compared or shared. The automation of the ESDA process would therefore have multiple benefits as it would not only save time, but it would also allow the data analyst to keep up with the rapid rate at which we generate data. This paper aims to introduce the first iteration of autoESDA {\textendash} a Python library capable of automating the ESDA process by summarising the results into a single report. In this paper, we present the defined high-level requirements for the implementation of autoESDA. Various dependency libraries are discussed and a high-level overview of the workflow of autoESDA is described. The library is then evaluated against the requirements laid out earlier in the study. Semi-structured interviews were carried out, which yielded a wealth of feedback and suggestions from the participants, describing how the output report could be improved. Finally, a roadmap of proposed further developments and improvements is discussed. The first version demonstrates that the automation of ESDA is possible and lays the foundation for further development in this regard. This is an important contribution to understanding spatial data as it enables the data analyst to keep up with the magnitude of data that is generated on a daily basis.},

Results indicate that the highest QoL neighbourhoods were most stable, while those with lower homeownership, closer to the city centre, exhibited the sharpest longitudinal trajectories. Lower-income neighbourhoods are found to be heterogeneous in terms of their social problems, dividing between high crime concentrations and youth-related social problems. An exchange of these social issues over time is observed as well as a geographical spread of crime to middle-ring suburbs.},

This article introduces a methodology to the study of spatial{\textendash}temporal patterns of neighborhood socioeconomic change. The approach first involves establishing discrete classes of neighborhoods following a k-means clustering procedure and then applies a sequential pattern mining algorithm to determine the similarity of longitudinal sequences. Sequences are then clustered to derive a typology of neighborhood trajectories. The method is employed in an empirical analysis of neighborhood change from 1970 to 2010 for all census tracts in the cities of Chicago and Los Angeles. In Chicago, this time period was marked by a sustained process of center city revitalization through two distinct upgrading processes, whereas in Los Angles, neighborhood upgrading largely came in the form of suburban upgrading. The spatial structure of neighborhood dynamics in Chicago resembled patterns described by Chicago School theorists, whereas the dynamics of Los Angeles deviated from this ordered regularity.},

In particular, it seeks to determine to what extent a neighborhood's geographic situation impacts its probability of improving or declining and is spatial proximity equally advantageous and detrimental. To answer these spatial dependence questions, we employ and expand upon a spatial Markov model. Aside from the standard weight matrix typically utilized in spatial Markov studies comprised of the mean value of a neighborhood's surrounding area, this paper furthers this conceptualization by exploring alternate specifications including the mode and upper and lower quartiles. Results suggest that spatial dependence plays a strong role in impacting biennial transitions, and when examining the upper and lower quartiles, this dependence is shown to be nonlinear and amplified at the extreme ends of the QoL spectrum. A case study of neighborhoods in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, during the 2000{\textendash}2010 decade is used to illustrate these concepts to the study of neighborhood dynamics.},

  abstract = {Rapid transformations sweeping the United States over the past 50 years have necessitated a reassessment of longstanding theories on how the neighborhood change process has unfolded. This article builds upon recent methodological advancements aimed at understanding longitudinal dynamics by developing a workflow that blends the self-organizing map and a sequential alignment method to visualize pathways of change in a multivariate context. It identifies the predominant pathways in which neighborhoods have changed according to their racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and housing characteristics in the largest US metropolitan statistical areas from 1980 to 2010. The distribution of these pathways is subsequently examined between metropolitan statistical areas and the spatial clustering of these trajectories within cities is analyzed. Results reveal a white-flight type process, the establishment of a multiethnic neighborhood, densification of singlefamily neighborhoods, gentrification in relatively diverse neighborhoods, upgrading of white single family neighborhoods, and the most frequent pathway of all: no change. High-poverty minority and wealthy white neighborhoods are most spatially compact and expanding in a contiguous manner, while multiethnic neighborhoods are relatively dispersed. Six groups of metropolitan statistical areas are identified based upon the similarity of their neighborhood composition. Parallels are drawn between the formation of enduring high-poverty black neighborhoods in Northern and Midwestern cities and the emergence of clusters high-poverty Hispanic neighborhoods in Hispanic destination cities.},

We train a cGAN to generate ground-level views of a location given overhead imagery. We show the "fake" ground-level images are natural looking and are structurally similar to the real images. More significantly, we show the generated images are representative of the locations and that the representations learned by the cGANs are informative. In particular, we show that dense feature maps generated using our framework are more effective for land-cover classification than approaches which spatially interpolate features extracted from sparse ground-level images. To our knowledge, ours is the first work to use cGANs to generate ground-level views given overhead imagery and to explore the benefits of the learned representations.},

It is shown that internal migration data can be usefully employed to help distribute flows subnationally both through in-migration and out-migration distributions and through calibrated distance-decay parameters. Validation of the model outputs is achieved, in part, through comparison with national insurance number registration data from the UK.},

We examine mobility in ranking during 2000{\textendash}2019 and shed light on the influence of neighbouring ports in a range as well as the level of maturity of each range. Findings from three different methods (Gini coefficient and the Lorenz curve; Markov chains; Spatial Markov Chains) show that, overall, there is a low probability for ports to change status and to enter into a new dynamic phase. Our results confirm that path dependence plays an important role in port systems, with very low inter-class mobility. When mobility occurs, it is mostly for small and medium ports, and this mobility is higher when ports are surrounded by large ports. These results suggest that competition with existing larger ports can be good for the port system rather than allowing traffic to concentrate in a small number of ports. Finally, mature port ranges can enter a renewed dynamic phase, as smaller ports seek either to compete for market share or alternatively seek mergers with large ports where competition possibilities are absent.},

The United States, the richest country on earth, has more poverty than any other advanced democracy. Why? Why does this land of plenty allow one in every eight of its children to go without basic necessities, permit scores of its citizens to live and die on the streets, and authorize its corporations to pay poverty wages? In this landmark book, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond draws on history, research, and original reporting to show how affluent Americans knowingly and unknowingly keep poor people poor. Those of us who are financially secure exploit the poor, driving down their wages while forcing them to overpay for housing and access to cash and credit. We prioritize the subsidization of our wealth over the alleviation of poverty, designing a welfare state that gives the most to those who need the least. And we stockpile opportunity in exclusive communities, creating zones of concentrated riches alongside those of concentrated despair. Some lives are made small so that others may grow. Elegantly written and fiercely argued, this compassionate book gives us new ways of thinking about a morally urgent problem. It also helps us imagine solutions. Desmond builds a startlingly original and ambitious case for ending poverty. He calls on us all to become poverty abolitionists, engaged in a politics of collective belonging to usher in a new age of shared prosperity and, at last, true freedom"--},

  abstract = {Growing up in a disadvantaged parental neighbourhood is related to long-term exposure to similar neighbourhoods as adults. However, there are multiple socio-spatial contexts besides the residential neighbourhood to which individuals are exposed over the life course, such as households, schools, and places of work and leisure, which also influence their outcomes. For children and adolescents, the school environment is especially important. We argue that leaving these contexts out of consideration in models of neighbourhood effects could lead to a misspecification of the relevance of the residential environment in determining individual outcomes. This study examines the joint influence of the parental background, the parental neighbourhood, and a compositional measure of the childhood school environment, on individual neighbourhood trajectories later in life. We use Dutch longitudinal register data to study a complete cohort of adolescents from 1999 to 2012. We fit cross-classified multilevel models to partition the variance of schools and parental neighbourhoods over time. We find that parental neighbourhood quality strongly determines children's residential outcomes later in life. The variation in individual neighbourhood outcomes at the school level is explained by the ethnicity, parental income, and personal income of the research population, suggesting grouping of children from particular backgrounds into specific school environments.},

  abstract = {The extensive literature on economic convergence has explored a wide variety of ways of measuring convergence in addition to finely tuning and improving the applicable econometric techniques. However, very few contributions analyze the relevance of the spatial level of analysis. Our hypothesis is that studying the convergence at the level of large regions (states) could conceal intraregional heterogeneity. This hypothesis is consistent with the New Economic Geography framework, which highlighted core-periphery patterns at the local level. However, this polarization mechanism may become difficult to identify with aggregated data or neoclassical dynamics operating at the same time. This paper proposes a multilevel approach to study this question. It allows the identification of possible heterogeneous local patterns of behavior within regions. It is applied to the US economy in a hierarchy of two levels: states and counties. The results show high intraclass correlation, indicating significant variance within states. An overall pattern of convergence is observed in line with previous results, although some states present internal patterns of divergence or significant changes in the rate of convergence.},

  abstract = {The ?-convergence model is based on the neoclassical framework in which the spatial level of analysis is not relevant. These levels will result in decreasing returns. However, local processes of agglomeration, spillover effects, or other forces could operate differently depending on the level of spatial disaggregation. The primary objective of this article is to observe whether different local, regional, and national convergence behaviors are possible in the European Union (EU). To capture the differences among spatial scales, a multilevel and spatial effects extension of the Solow?Swan theoretical growth model is proposed. The estimations of this model are made using consistent information from Eurostat and Cambridge Econometrics for the period of 2000?2014. A multilevel spatial Durbin model estimator is applied to evaluate the spatial interactions of the regions. The results indicate that a general process of convergence in the EU coexists with intranational processes of divergence, highlighting the relevance of the spatial level of analysis. A final analysis of the impact of the economic crisis over the general behavior has been included verifying that the economic crisis strongly reinforce the weakness of the EU convergence.}

Multilevel analysis has emerged as one analytical strategy that may partly address this need, by allowing the simultaneous examination of group-level and individual-level factors. This paper reviews the rationale for using multilevel analysis in public health research, summarizes the statistical methodology, and highlights some of the research questions that have been addressed using these methods. The advantages and disadvantages of multi level analysis compared with standard methods are reviewed. The use of multilevel analysis raises theoretical and methodological issues related to the theoretical model being tested, the conceptual distinction between group and individual-level variables, the ability to differentiate ``independent'' effects, the reciprocal relationships between factors at different levels, and the increased complexity that these models imply. The potentialities and limitations of multilevel analysis, within the broader context of understanding the role of factors defined at multiple levels in shaping health outcomes, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Readily available high resolution data on population distribution is an important resource for monitoring humanenvironment interactions and for supporting planning and management decisions. Using a grid that approximates population density over the entire country seems like the most practical approach to exploring and distributing detailed population data but instead data based on census aggregation units is still the most widely used method. In this paper we describe the construction of 30 m resolution grid representing the distribution of population in 2010 over the entire conterminous United States. The grid is computed using 2010 U.S. Census block level population counts disaggregated by a dasymetric model that uses land cover (2011 NLCD) and land use (2010 NLUD) as ancillary data. Detailed descriptions of the ancillary data and dasymetric model are given. Methods of computing the grid are presented followed by an extensive assessment of model accuracy. Overall the expected value for relative error of the model is 44\% which is at the lower limit of errors reported for other continental-sized, high resolution population grids. We also offer a more specific error estimate for areas with specified value of population density. Using two example areas, one highly urbanized and another rural, we demonstrate the advantages of using the gridded population data over the census block-based data. Our 30 m population grid is available for online exploration and for download from the custom-made GeoWeb application SocScape at http://sil.uc.edu.},

We used spatial modeling to identify areas hardest hit to spatially optimize naloxone distribution among pharmacies in Pittsburgh. Results. We identified 3182 opioid overdose events with our classification approach, which generated spatial patterns of opioid overdoses within Pittsburgh. We then used overdose location to spatially optimize accessibility to naloxone via pharmacies in the city. Only 24 pharmacies offered naloxone at the time, and only 3 matched with our optimized solution. Conclusions. Our methodology rapidly identified communities hardest hit by the opioid epidemic with standard public health data. Naloxone accessibility can be optimized with established location{\textendash}allocation approaches.},

Compared with the emerging Bayesian spatial and temporal approach, the Bayesian spatio-temporal interaction model contributes to a detailed understanding of differential trends through analyzing and mapping probabilities of area-specific crash trends as differing from the mean trend and highlights specific locations where crash occurrence is deteriorating or improving over time. With traffic analysis zones (TAZs) crash data collected in Florida, an empirical analysis was conducted to evaluate the following three approaches for hotspot identification: FB ranking using a Poisson-lognormal (PLN) model, FB ranking using a Bayesian spatial and temporal (B-ST) model and FB ranking using a Bayesian spatio-temporal interaction (B-ST-I) model. The results show that (a) the models accounting for space-time effects perform better in safety ranking than does the PLN model, and (b) the FB approach using the B-ST-I model significantly outperforms the B-ST approach in correctly identifying hotspots by explicitly accounting for the space-time variation in addition to the stable spatial/temporal patterns of crash occurrence. In practice, the B-ST-I approach plays key roles in addressing two issues: (a) how the identified hotspots have evolved over time and (b) the identification of areas that, whilst not yet hotspots, show a tendency to become hotspots. Finally, it can provide guidance to policy decision makers to efficiently improve zonal-level safety.},

  abstract = {Social and physical processes often exhibit both macro-level geographic smoothness {\textendash} implying positive spatial dependence {\textendash} and micro-level discontinuities {\textendash} suggesting implicit step changes or boundaries in the data. However, a simultaneous treatment of the two features in a unified statistical model poses great challenges. This study extends an innovative locally adaptive spatial auto-regressive modelling approach to a multi-level modelling framework in order to explore multiple-scale geographical data. It develops a Bayesian locally adaptive spatial multi-level model that takes into account horizontal global spatial dependence and local step changes, as well as a vertical group dependency effect imposed by the multiple-scale data structure. At its heart, the correlation structures of spatial units implied by a spatial weights matrix are learned along with other model parameters using an iterative estimation algorithm, rather than being assumed to be invariant and exogenous. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler for implementing this new spatial multi-level model is derived. The developed methodology is applied to infer neighbourhood quality using property transaction data, and to examine potential correlates of neighbourhood quality in Liverpool. The results reveal a complex and fragmented geography of neighbourhood quality; besides an overall smoothness trend, boundaries delimiting neighbourhood quality are scattered across Liverpool. Socio-economics, built environment, and locational characteristics are statistically significantly associated with neighbourhood quality.},

  abstract = {Exploring the spatio-temporal dynamics of poverty is important for research on sustainable poverty reduction in China. Based on the perspective of development geography, this paper proposes a panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model that combines the human development approach with the global indicator framework for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to identify the poverty-causing and the poverty-reducing factors in China. The aim is to measure the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) of China's provinces from 2007 to 2017, and use the exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis (ESTDA) method to reveal the characteristics of the spatio-temporal dynamics of multidimensional poverty. The results show the following: (1) The poverty-causing factors in China include the high social gross dependency ratio and crop-to-disaster ratio, and the poverty-reducing factors include the high per capita GDP, per capita social security expenditure, per capita public health expenditure, number of hospitals per 10,000 people, rate of participation in the new rural cooperative medical scheme, vegetation coverage, per capita education expenditure, number of universities, per capita research and development (R\&D) expenditure, and funding per capita for cultural undertakings. (2) From 2007 to 2017, provincial income poverty (IP), health poverty (HP), cultural poverty (CP), and multidimensional poverty have been significantly reduced in China, and the overall national poverty has dropped by 5.67\% annually. there is a differentiation in poverty along different dimensions in certain provinces. (3) During the study period, the local spatial pattern of multidimensional poverty between provinces showed strong spatial dynamics, and a trend of increase from the eastern to the central and western regions was noted. The MPI among provinces exhibited a strong spatial dependence over time to form a pattern of decrease from northwestern and northeastern China to the surrounding areas. (4) The spatio-temporal networks of multidimensional poverty in adjacent provinces were mainly negatively correlated, with only Shaanxi and Henan, Shaanxi and Ningxia, Qinghai and Gansu, Hubei and Anhui, Sichuan and Guizhou, and Hainan and Guangdong forming spatially strong cooperative poverty reduction relationships. These results have important reference value for the implementation of China's poverty alleviation strategy.},

  abstract = {Frequently, social networks are studied in their own right with analyses devoid of contextual details. Yet contextual features {\textendash} both social and spatial {\textendash} can have impacts on the networks formed within them. This idea is explored with five empirical networks representing different contexts and the use of distinct modeling strategies. These strategies include network visualizations, QAP regression, exponential random graph models, blockmodeling and a combination of blockmodels with exponential random graph models within a single framework. We start with two empirical examples of networks inside organizations. The familiar Bank Wiring Room data show that the social organization (social context) and spatial arrangement of the room help account for the social relations formed there. The second example comes from a police academy where two designed arrangements, one social and one spatial, powerfully determine the relational social structures formed by recruits. The next example is an inter-organizational network that emerged as part of a response to a natural disaster where features of the improvised context helped account for the relations that formed between organizations participating in the search and rescue mission. We then consider an anthropological example of signed relations among sub-tribes in the New Guinea highlands where the physical geography is fixed. This is followed by a trading network off the Dalmatian coast where geography and physical conditions matter. Through these examples, we show that context matters by shaping the structure of networks that form and that a variety of network analytic tools can be mobilized to reveal how networks are shaped, in part, by social and spatial contexts. Implications for studying social networks are suggested.},

  abstract = {Racialized space has been used to explain the emergence of environmental racism and injustice. Central to this hypothesis is the history of uneven development in cities, coupled with persistent racial residential segregation. Beginning in the late 1930s, the federal Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) surveyed over 200 midsized American cities to create comprehensive records of mortgage risk, commonly referred to as redlining maps. Many scholars acknowledge their significance in shaping early home and urban development policy. However, there has been relatively little work done using these maps, primarily because of their limited access. This article presents a methodology for an efficient digitization of redlining maps and provides an overview of variables within the HOLC risk map survey, called Security Area Descriptions. Work is based on a pilot study of seven central New York cities: Binghamton, Albany, Rochester, Syracuse, Elmira, Rome, and Buffalo. Key steps include the overlay and georeferencing of high-resolution copies of the original HOLC maps by using contemporary street maps, and the construction of a comprehensive database by using information derived from the Security Area Descriptions. Here we present this methodology and our initial findings in the relationship between race, socioeconomic status, and marginalized space.

Signed into law in 2002, the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act provided the program with a congressional mandate, new tools to promote reuse such as liability protections, and increased funding up to a level of \$250 million per year. This article contributes to research on environmental regulatory reform with an analysis of successful and unsuccessful local government applicants for EPA Brownfields Program support between 2003 and 2007. Building on prior research, we develop a series of expectations and an empirical model, and estimate the influence of program priorities, government and civic capacity, interest group pressures, and institutional politics. Results point to significant relationships between program priorities and award patterns. Contrary both to EPA's explicit commitments to equity and to analysis of pre-2003 award patterns, however, we find negative correlations between the proportions of local populations that are nonwhite or low-income and the likelihood of receiving an award. In addition, better-resourced governments and several dimensions of political representation show strong associations with the likelihood of winning awards. We conclude by discussing implications.},

Observed associations may be causal or result from uncontrolled confounds related to family upbringing. Twin designs can help neighborhood effects studies overcome selection and reverse causation problems in specifying causal mechanisms. Beyond quantifying genetic effects (i.e., heritability coefficients), we provide examples of innovative measures and analytic methods that use twins as quasi-experimental controls for confounding by environmental effects. We conclude that collaboration among investigators from multiple fields can move the field forward by designing studies that step toward causation.},

  abstract = {The opioid epidemic in the United States carries significant morbidity and mortality and requires a coordinated response among emergency providers, outpatient providers, public health departments, and communities. Anecdotally, providers across the spectrum of care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, MA have noticed that Charlestown, a community in northeast Boston, has been particularly impacted by the opioid epidemic and needs both emergency and longer-term resources. We hypothesized that geospatial analysis of the home addresses of patients presenting to the MGH emergency department (ED) with opioid-related emergencies might identify "hot spots" of opioid-related healthcare needs within Charlestown that could then be targeted for further investigation and resource deployment. Here, we present a geospatial analysis at the United States census tract level of the home addresses of all patients who presented to the MGH ED for opioid-related emergency visits between 7/1/2012 and 6/30/2015, including 191 visits from 100 addresses in Charlestown, MA. Among the six census tracts that comprise Charlestown, we find a 9.5-fold difference in opioid-related ED visits, with 45\% of all opioid-related visits from Charlestown originating in tract 040401. The signal from this census tract remains strong after adjusting for population differences between census tracts, and while this tract is one of the higher utilizing census tracts in Charlestown of the MGH ED for all cause visits, it also has a 2.9-fold higher rate of opioid-related visits than the remainder of Charlestown. Identifying this hot spot of opioid-related emergency needs within Charlestown may help re-distribute existing resources efficiently, empower community and ED-based physicians to advocate for their patients, and serve as a catalyst for partnerships between MGH and local community groups. More broadly, this analysis demonstrates that EDs can use geospatial analysis to address the emergency and longer-term health needs of the communities they are designed to serve.},

For that purpose, this article introduces the formal notion of the family of \&agr;-shapes of a finite point set in R3. Each shape is a well-defined polytope, derived from the Delaunay triangulation of the point set, with a parameter \&agr; \&egr; R controlling the desired level of detail. An algorithm is presented that constructs the entire family of shapes for a given set of size n in time 0(n2), worst case. A robust implementation of the algorithm is discussed, and several applications in the area of scientific computing are mentioned.},

  abstract = {"Three of the nation's top scholars, known for tackling key mysteries about poverty in America, turn their attention from the country's poorest people to its poorest places. Based on a fresh, data-driven approach, they discover that America's most disadvantaged communities are not the big cities that get the most notice. Instead, nearly all are rural. Little if any attention has been paid to these places or to the people who make their lives there. This revelation set in motion a five-year journey across Appalachia, the Cotton and Tobacco Belts of the Deep South, and South Texas. Immersing themselves in these communities, pouring over centuries of local history, attending parades and festivals, the authors trace the legacies of the deepest poverty in America, including inequalities shaping people's health, livelihoods, and upward social mobility for families. Wrung dry by powerful forces and corrupt government officials, the "internal colonies" in these regions were exploited for their resources and then left to collapse. The unfolding revelation in The Injustice of Place is not about what sets these places apart, but about what they have in common: a history of raw, intensive resource extraction and human exploitation. This history and its reverberations demand a reckoning and a commitment to wage a new War on Poverty, with the unrelenting focus on our nation's places of deepest need"-- Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {Practical needs in geographic information systems (GIS) have led to the investigation of formal and sound methods of describing spatial relations. After an introduction to the basic ideas and notions of topology, a novel theory of topological spatial relations between sets is developed in which the relations are defined in terms of the intersections of the boundaries and interiors of two sets. By considering empty and non-empty as the values of the intersections, a total of sixteen topological spatial relations is described, each of which can be realized in R 2. This set is reduced to nine relations if the sets are restricted to spatial regions, a fairly broad class of subsets of a connected topological space with an application to GIS. It is shown that these relations correspond to some of the standard set theoretical and topological spatial relations between sets such as equality, disjointness and containment in the interior.},

  abstract = {Significant increases in the volume of big spatial data have driven researchers and practitioners to build specialized systems to process and analyze this data. Existing efforts focus on either big raster data, e.g., remote sensing data or medical images, or big vector data, e.g., geotagged tweets or trajectories. However, when raster and vector data mix, one dataset must be converted to the other representation requiring vector-to-raster or raster-to-vector transformation before processing, which is extremely inefficient for large datasets. In this paper, we advocate a third approach that mixes the raw representations of both vector and raster data in the query processor. As a case study, we apply this to the zonal statistics problem, which computes the statistics over a raster layer for each polygon in a vector layer. We propose a novel method, called Scanline method, which does not require a conversion between raster and vector. Experimental evaluation on real datasets as large as 840 billion pixels shows up to three orders of magnitude speedup over the baseline methods.},

The present study investigates this question by extracting both object and texture features from satellite images of Sri Lanka. These features are used to estimate poverty rates and average expected log consumption taken from small-area estimates derived from census data, for 1,291 administrative units. Features extracted include the number and density of buildings, the prevalence of building shadows (proxying building height), the number of cars, length of roads, type of agriculture, roof material, and several texture and spectral features. A linear regression model explains between 49 and 61 percent of the variation in average expected log consumption, and between 37 and 62 percent for poverty rates. Estimates remain accurate throughout the consumption distribution, and when extrapolating predictions into adjacent areas, although performance falls when using fewer households to calculate estimates of poverty and welfare.},

We present here the changing landscape of opportunity in large metropolitan areas in the United States to describe how the spatial structure of opportu\- nity is evolving. Using decomposable inequality indices, we break down the spatial inequality of opportunity into two components: inequality within subareas (inner cities, inner suburbs, and outer suburbs) and inequality between subareas. According to our findings, economic opportunity is pri\- marily driven by inequality within subareas. The situation is particularly evident in metropolitan areas where suburban employment is growing con\- currently with the suburbanization of Black and Hispanic populations. Our findings suggest that the geography of metropolitan opportunity in the U.S. is changing in ways that will alter our traditional understanding of the relationship between race, space, and economic opportunity.},

  abstract = {An algorithm for causal recursive parameter estimation of a discrete-time hidden bivariate Markov chain is developed. In this model, a discrete-time bivariate Markov chain is observed through a discrete-time memoryless channel. The algorithm relies on the EM-based recursive approach developed by Stiller and Radons for hidden Markov models. A distinct advantage of the discrete-time hidden bivariate Markov chain model is that the sojourn time distribution of its observable process in each state is phase-type rather than geometric as in the hidden Markov model. Phase-type distributions can approximate any desired sojourn time distribution. Particular phase-type distributions include mixtures and convolutions of geometric distributions. The parameter estimation algorithm requires causal recursive estimation of the relevant statistics in each EM step. These statistics include the number of jumps of the bivariate Markov chain from one state to another, including self transitions, in the given observation interval, and first- and second-order statistical averages of the observable process in each state when the memoryless channel is Gaussian. We develop the explicit recursions and demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in estimating the model's parameter and its sojourn time distribution in a numerical example.},

Despite the large number of papers published on the subject of graph labeling, there are few particular techniques to be used by researchers to gracefully label graphs. In this paper, first a new approach based on the mathematical programming technique is presented to model the graceful labeling problem. Then a ``branching method'' is developed to solve the problem for special classes of graphs. Computational results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for different classes of graphs. One of the interesting results of our model is in the class of trees. The largest tree known to be graceful has at most 27 vertices but our model can easily solve the graceful labeling for trees with 40 vertices.},

The resources are presented in an incremental order, starting with theoretical foundations and moving on to applied issues. In addition, we outline an additional 32 articles and books that can be consulted to gain background knowledge about various theoretical specifics and Bayesian approaches to frequently used models. Our goal is to offer researchers a starting point for understanding the core tenets of Bayesian analysis, while requiring a low level of time commitment. After consulting our guide, the reader should understand how and why Bayesian methods work, and feel able to evaluate their use in the behavioral and social sciences.},

  abstract = {Emerging world countries have experienced over the last two decades a significant change in their trade patterns. Bold trade reforms have been followed by rapid rises in international trade levels. However, despite these radical changes, we know remarkably little about how changes in trade patterns are affecting the evolution of regional inequality in the developing world. This paper addresses the link between trade openness and spatial inequality across 22 emerging countries over the period between 1990 and 2006. Our findings show that changes in international trade bring about a significant rise in within-country inequality across the developing world and that this impact is greatest in the poorest countries. This result is robust to the inclusion of a number of control variables, and to changes in the specification of the sample and in the measure used to quantify the level of regional disparities. Consequently, the increase in trade exposure across the emerging world, while possibly benefiting the countries involved in the process in aggregate terms, is generating winning and losing regions.},

The results show that the level of interregional inequality has a positive and statistically significant effect on the incidence of civil conflict, which implies that countries with higher regional income disparities are more likely to experience internal violence. This result is not driven by a specific group of influential countries and is robust to the inclusion in the analysis of a substantial set of covariates that may affect both interregional inequality and civil conflict. Likewise, the observed link between regional income disparities and internal violence does not depend either on the estimation strategy or the measures used to quantify the degree of interregional inequality and the incidence of civil conflict within the various countries. These results suggest that policies designed to decrease the magnitude of regional income disparities may contribute to reducing the incidence of civil conflict.},

  abstract = {The Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), established in the US during the Great Depression to provide relief to a failing housing market, had a lasting effect through institutionalising the segregationist practice of denying mortgages to communities of colour. Over subsequent decades, `redlining' funnelled billions of US dollars away from minority neighbourhoods and shaped segregation patterns {\textendash} constituting perhaps the most influential example of institutional intervention in the hierarchy of places. This history of racialised exclusion via the process of `spatial marking' is reflected in contemporary housing inequality, which remains one of the most severe sites of racial stratification. This article combines newly-digitised archival data with data describing recent mortgage outcomes to investigate the role of institutional classification of place in the persistence of housing finance inequality. I show that borrowers in the 21st century were at a severe disadvantage when pursuing mortgages in neighbourhoods redlined by HOLC appraisers in the early 20th century. Such applicants were more likely to be denied loans and to receive subprime loans net of measures of selection and ecological disadvantage. This article shows that the geographical patterns of exclusion and exploitation are remarkably stable, and highlights the role of persistent institutional marginalisation in replicating racial and spatial inequalities.},

  abstract = {The contemporary practice of homeownership in the United States was born out of government programs adopted during the New Deal. The Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC){\textemdash}and later the Federal Housing Administration and GI Bill{\textemdash}expanded home buying opportunity, although in segregationist fashion. Through mechanisms such as redlining, these policies fueled white suburbanization and black ghettoization, while laying the foundation for the racial wealth gap. This is the first article to investigate the long-term consequences of these policies on the segregation of cities. I combine a full century of census data with archival data to show that cities HOLC appraised became more segregated than those it ignored. The gap emerged between 1930 and 1950 and remains significant: in 2010, the black-white dissimilarity, black isolation, and white-black information theory indices are 12, 16, and 8 points higher in appraised cities, respectively. Results are consistent across a range of robustness checks, including exploitation of imperfect implementation of appraisal guidelines and geographic spillover. These results contribute to current theoretical discussions about the persistence of segregation. The long-term impact of these policies is a reminder of the intentionality that shaped racial geography in the United States, and the scale of intervention that will be required to disrupt the persistence of segregation.},

  abstract = {To increase the effectiveness of graduate research training, many universities have introduced boot camps and bridge programs lasting several days to several weeks. National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health currently support such interventions with nearly \$28 million in active awards. Previous evidence for the efficacy of this format exists primarily in the form of anecdotes and end-of-course surveys. Here we show that participation in such short-format interventions is not associated with observable benefits related to skill development, scholarly productivity, or socialization into the academic community. Analyzing data from 294 PhD students in life sciences from 53 US institutions, we found no evidence of effectiveness across 115 variables. We conclude that boot camps and other short formats may not durably impact student outcomes., Many PhD programs incorporate boot camps and summer bridge programs to accelerate the development of doctoral students' research skills and acculturation into their respective disciplines. These brief, high-intensity experiences span no more than several weeks and are typically designed to expose graduate students to data analysis techniques, to develop scientific writing skills, and to better embed incoming students into the scholarly community. However, there is no previous study that directly measures the outcomes of PhD students who participate in such programs and compares them to the outcomes of students who did not participate. Likewise, no previous study has used a longitudinal design to assess these outcomes over time. Here we show that participation in such programs is not associated with detectable benefits related to skill development, socialization into the academic community, or scholarly productivity for students in our sample. Analyzing data from 294 PhD students in the life sciences from 53 US institutions, we found no statistically significant differences in outcomes between participants and nonparticipants across 115 variables. These results stand in contrast to prior studies presenting boot camps as effective interventions based on participant satisfaction and perceived value. Many universities and government agencies (e.g., National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation) invest substantial resources in boot camp and summer bridge activities in the hopes of better supporting scientific workforce development. Our findings do not reveal any measurable benefits to students, indicating that an allocation of limited resources to alternative strategies with stronger empirical foundations warrants consideration.},

Although evidence has largely supported the EEA, critics have claimed that environmental similarity has not been measured well, and most studies of the EEA have focused on outcomes related to health and psychology. This article addresses these limitations through (1) a reanalysis of data from the most cited study of the EEA, Loehlin and Nichols (1976), using better measures, and through (2) an analysis of nationally representative twin data from MIDUS using more comprehensive controls on a wider variety of outcomes than previous studies. Results support a middle ground position; it is likely that the EEA is not strictly valid for most outcomes, but the resulting bias is likely modest.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Intraspecific and interspecific interactions regulate the extent and spatial patterns of animal home ranges. If we are able to estimate the home range overlap for a large number of individuals, populations and/or species, then we can readily identify important ecological properties, such as social network structure, competition during the breeding season, contact rates with implications for disease transmission, change in space use over time, interactions among different age classes and site fidelity for a particular individual, population or species. We can also evaluate the robustness of probabilistic home range assessment through the degree of overlap of several estimators. Accordingly, in this study, we first solve the issue of measuring the degree of overlap/segregation among a large number of probabilistic animal home ranges and provide a demonstrative case study. Abstract Home range overlap/segregation has several important applications to wildlife conservation and management. In this work, we first address the issue of measuring the degree of overlap/segregation among an arbitrarily large number (i.e., n {$\geq$} 2) of probabilistic animal home ranges (i.e., utilization distributions). This subject matter has recently been solved for home ranges measured as polygons (e.g., percent minimum convex polygons and multinuclear cores) but not yet for probabilistic ones. Accordingly, we introduce a novel index named the PGOI (probabilistic general overlap index), and its complement, the PGSI (probabilistic general segregation index), an index for computation of probabilistic home range overlap/segregation at individual, population and species levels. Whatever the number of probabilistic home ranges, the PGOI returns a single score ranging in the [0, 100] interval. We applied the PGOI to five lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni) at Santeramo in Colle (Apulia region; Southern Italy) as a case study. Our new index can be applied to any animal species and to home ranges derived from any type of probabilistic home range estimator.},

The objective is to measure distance, institutional, language and technological barrier effects that may hamper collaborative activities between European regions. Particular emphasis is laid on measuring discrepancies between two types of collaborative R\&D activities, those generating output in terms of scientific publications and those that do not. The study area is composed of 255 NUTS-2 regions that cover the pre-2007 member states of the European Union (excluding Malta and Cyprus) as well as Norway and Switzerland. We employ a negative binomial spatial interaction model specification to address the research question, along with an eigenvector spatial filtering technique suggested by Fischer and Griffith (2008) to account for the presence of network autocorrelation in the origin{\textendash}destination cooperation data. The study provides evidence that the role of geographical distance as collaborative deterrent is significantly lower if collaborations generate scientific output. Institutional barriers do not play a significant role for collaborations with scientific output. Language and technological barriers are smaller but the estimates indicate no significant discrepancies between the two types of collaborative R\&D activities that are in focus of this study.},

  abstract = {Cities are complex products of human culture, characterised by a startling diversity of visible traits. Their form is constantly evolving, reflecting changing human needs and local contingencies, manifested in space by many urban patterns. Urban morphology laid the foundation for understanding many such patterns, largely relying on qualitative research methods to extract distinct spatial identities of urban areas. However, the manual, labour-intensive and subjective nature of such approaches represents an impediment to the development of a scalable, replicable and datadriven urban form characterisation. Recently, advances in geographic data science and the availability of digital mapping products open the opportunity to overcome such limitations. And yet, our current capacity to systematically capture the heterogeneity of spatial patterns remains limited in terms of spatial parameters included in the analysis and hardly scalable due to the highly labourintensive nature of the task. In this paper, we present a method for numerical taxonomy of urban form derived from biological systematics, which allows the rigorous detection and classification of urban types. Initially, we produce a rich numerical characterisation of urban space from minimal data input, minimising limitations due to inconsistent data quality and availability. These are street network, building footprint and morphological tessellation, a spatial unit derivative of Voronoi tessellation, obtained from building footprints. Hence, we derive homogeneous urban tissue types and, by determining overall morphological similarity between them, generate a hierarchical classification of urban form. After framing and presenting the method, we test it on two cities {\textendash} Prague and Amsterdam {\textendash} and discuss potential applications and further developments. The proposed classification method represents a step towards the development of an extensive, scalable numerical taxonomy of urban form and opens the way to more rigorous comparative morphological studies and explorations into the relationship between urban space and phenomena as diverse as environmental performance, health and place attractiveness.},

  abstract = {This article brings together a number of new specification search strategies in spatial econometric modeling. In the literature, experimental results for several forward stepwise strategies aimed at remedying spatial dependence, have been reported. Essentially, these strategies boil down to the expansion of a spatial linear regression model with spatially lagged variables, conditional upon the results of misspecification tests. We investigate a Hendry-like specification strategy, starting from the spatial common factor model and subsequently reducing the number of spatially lagged variables on the basis of significance tests. The experimental simulations pertain to various small to large sample sizes, with spatial processes modeled on regular lattice surfaces. Our main conclusion is that the classical forward stepwise approach outperforms the Hendry strategy in terms of finding the true data generating process as well as in the observed accuracy of the estimators for spatial and non-spatial parameters. It also dominates concurrent forward stepwise strategies recently suggested in the literature.},

By using discrete and spatial Markov chains models, probability transitions of labour specialization and its associated proximate effect to leading states {\textendash} in terms of either a higher level of specialization or technological intensity {\textendash} are estimated.

However, collective action dynamics in rapidly changing urban neighborhoods are not well understood. This study used photovoice to examine perspectives on collective action and neighborhood change among residents of an urban neighborhood experiencing redevelopment in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Residents indicated that place attachment motivated and reinforced participation in collective action efforts to address neighborhood issues and to reconstruct narratives that challenged place stigmatization. Findings suggest that residents have heterogeneous perspectives about neighborhood change and local development, and simultaneously balance desires for neighborhood improvement with concerns about displacement, gentrification, and equitable development.},

However, this critical data source has high uncertainty in some of its most frequently used estimates. Using 2006{\textendash}2010 ACS median household income estimates at the census tract scale as a test case, we explore spatial and nonspatial patterns in ACS estimate quality. We find that spatial patterns of uncertainty in the northern United States differ from those in the southern United States, and they are also different in suburbs than in urban cores. In both cases, uncertainty is lower in the former than the latter. In addition, uncertainty is higher in areas with lower incomes. We use a series of multivariate spatial regression models to describe the patterns of association between uncertainty in estimates and economic, demographic, and geographic factors, controlling for the number of responses. We find that these demographic and geographic patterns in estimate quality persist even after we account for the number of responses. Our results indicate that data quality varies across places, making cross-sectional analysis both within and across regions less reliable.

Hierarchical decisionmaking violates the Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives property embedded in the theoretical derivation of the production-constrained gravity model from choice axioms. Various aspects of gravity model misspecification resulting from hierarchical destination choice are investigated and an empirical example is given in terms of US migrants. A discussion is presented of several destination choice models that are more accurately specified than the gravity formulation when destination choice is hierarchical. The recently derived competing destinations formulation is shown to be amongst the most useful in this respect. The discussion is framed in the context of discrete choice theory.},

Recruitment was almost three-fold greater in the second sample period. Spatial pattern of focal species density was related to density of other juveniles, proximity of conspecific adults and canopy cover in the two years using Seemingly Unrelated Regression. Shade-tolerant species were the most abundant recruits in late-successional sites, establishing near-conspecific adults and other juveniles, while shade-establishing species were recruiting in gaps in second-growth forest where they also constitute the canopy trees. This pattern, observed in both years, reinforces divergent successional trajectories for second-growth and late-successional forest.},

In particular, we focus on the demographic structure and international diversity of the editorial teams of flagship quantitative geography journals. We find that women are underrepresented in our sample, with shares ranging from 23.1 to 43.5 percent{\textemdash}numbers unfortunately comparable to many other geography journals. We also find that career stage is an important factor and that our sample is more international and less Anglophone than the disciplinary norm. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of attending to issues of inclusive gatekeeping in geography and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Fleet composition and vehicle spacing on roads are important inputs to mobile source emission models and traffic planning. In this paper, we present a novel method that employs an unmanned aerial system (UAS) to capture imagery of stationary vehicle formations at two different intersections and times of the day. The imagery is processed through photogrammetric software to generate 3-dimensional (3D) models of the formations allowing for measurement of the stacking gaps and identification of individual vehicle types for fleet composition evaluation. Statistical tests were performed on the different flight results to assess traffic behavior (both composition and gaps) were similar and can be pooled. In both cases, the variation of fleet composition and gaps were similar. However, the stationary headway gaps followed a logarithmic distribution and had to be transformed after pooling. The final results of the fleet composition measured varied significantly from the estimated mix based on registered vehicles, while the average vehicle spacing was approximately 2.17 m and did not depend on vehicle type, location or time of day. These results were used to prepare a Monte Carlo Analysis model to estimate the total number and types of vehicles on a 1 km road section. The model was extended from stationary traffic to traffic moving up to 20 km/h by assuming a linear increase of the spacing gap. This research paper is one of the first of its kind to study the stacking spaces of mixed fleets at signalized intersections and shows that spacing is dependent more on individual driver behavior than vehicle type.},

  abstract = {Background: This paper examines neighborhood, outlet, and server characteristics related to successful purchases of alcohol by intoxicated patrons and underage drinkers at alcohol establishments. It is hypothesized that outlets in commercial areas near to other premises, with poor exterior maintenance, much advertising, and inexperienced youthful servers will be more likely to sell alcohol to intoxicated and underage patrons. Methods: Data were collected using pseudo-intoxicated patron and apparent minor surveys of randomly selected alcohol establishments in a metropolitan area of northern California. Data collection operations included independent surveillance of these drinking places to establish neighborhood and premise characteristics and pseudo-intoxicated patron and apparent minor stings to assess rates of these forms of illegal alcohol sales. Male actors feigning intoxication and female of-age youth identified as appearing to be 20 years or younger attempted to purchase alcohol at on- and off-premise establishments, respectively. Rates of sales (off-premise) and service (on-premise) were the primary outcomes. Results: Apparent minors purchased alcohol in 39\% of attempts (95\% CI, 34-45\%) while pseudo-intoxicated patrons were served alcohol in 58\% of attempts (95\% CI, 50-67\%). Sales to apparent minors were significantly related to percentage of Hispanic residents and areas with greater population density. Sales to pseudo-intoxicated patrons were more frequent when the server was male and appeared to be under the age of 30. These sales were also more frequent in Hispanic neighborhoods with high population density and high numbers of on-premise outlets but were less frequent in African American neighborhoods. Conclusion: The findings suggest that underage and intoxicated patron sales differ by areas. Both forms of illegal sales of alcohol are more likely in highly populated areas of communities. The findings also suggest that server characteristics are strongly related to sales to intoxicated patrons, suggesting some leverage for responsible beverage service programs in these environments.}

  abstract = {Alcohol outlet oversaturation often exacerbates negative public health outcomes. Recently, Baltimore City passed an extensive zoning rewrite (``TransForm Baltimore'') that sought to give local government and residents a tool to reduce alcohol outlet oversaturation through land use regulation. The present investigation evaluated the outlet and neighborhood characteristics of stores impacted by two components of TransForm Baltimore: (1) a requirement that taverns licensed for on-premise consumption in addition to off-premise, carryout sales generate at least 50\% of their business from on-premise sales, and (2) a requirement to close, repurpose, or relocate all package stores (i.e., off-premise alcohol outlets) that have been operating as ``non-conforming'' in residential zones since 1971. Research assistants visited every off-premise alcohol outlet in the city (n = 685) to complete an observational assessment. Approximately 77\% (n = 530) of these off-premise alcohol outlets were open, including 292 taverns and 238 package stores. t tests and chi-square tests were used to compare neighborhood characteristics (neighborhood disadvantage, median household income, and racial segregation) of sham taverns (i.e., taverns with less than 50\% space dedicated for on-premise sales that were primarily operating as a package store) and non-conforming package stores. Of the 292 taverns accessible during the study, the remainder were chronically closed (n = 130); 24 (8.2\%) were deemed sham taverns. Sham taverns were more likely to be located in communities with more economic disadvantage and lower median household income (t test; p {$<$} 0.05). Compared to taverns, a lower proportion of sham taverns had visible dance floor space, patrons drinking, and menus available (chi-square test; p {$<$} 0.001). There were 80 residentially zoned, non-conforming alcohol outlets. These non-conforming alcohol outlets were disproportionately distributed in predominately poor and African American communities (t test; p {$<$} 0.05). As compared to conforming alcohol outlets, more non-conforming alcohol outlets sold sex paraphernalia and healthy foods (chi-square test; p {$<$} 0.05). With active enforcement, TransForm Baltimore offers the opportunity for local government and residents to improve public health and increase health equity in vulnerable and marginalized neighborhoods.},

Given the growth in geographical data production, and the various mandates to make sharing of data a priority, there is a pressing need to facilitate the appropriate uptake and reuse of geographical data. However, describing the meaning and quality of data and thus finding data to fit a specific need remain as open problems, despite much research on these themes over many years. We have strong metadata standards for describing facts about data, and ontologies to describe semantic relationships among data, but these do not yet provide a viable basis on which to describe and share data reliably. We contend that one reason for this is the highly contextual and situated nature of geographic data, something that current models do not capture well {\textemdash} and yet they could. We show in this paper that a reconceptualization of geographical information in terms of Peirce's Pragmatics (specifically firstness, secondness and thirdness) can provide the necessary modeling power for representing situations of data use and data production, and for recognizing that we do not all see and understand in the same way. This in turn provides additional dimensions by which intentions and purpose can be brought into the representation of geographical data. Doing so does not solve all problems related to sharing meaning, but it gives us more to work with. Practically speaking, enlarging the focus from data model descriptions to descriptions of the pragmatics of the data {\textemdash} community, task, and domain semantics {\textemdash} allows us to describe the how, who, and why of data. These pragmatics offer a mechanism to differentiate between the perceived meanings of data as seen by different users, specifically in our examples herein between producers and consumers. Formally, we propose a generative graphical model for geographic data production through pragmatic description spaces and a pragmatic data description relation. As a simple demonstration of viability, we also show how this model can be used to learn knowledge about the community, the tasks undertaken, and even domain categories, from text descriptions of data and use-cases that are currently available.

  abstract = {GIScience and GISystems have been successful in tackling many geographical problems over the last 30 years. But technologies and associated theory can become limiting if they end up defining how we see the world and what we believe are worthy and tractable research problems. This paper explores some of the limitations currently impacting GISystems and GIScience from the perspective of technology and community, contrasting GIScience with other informatics communities and their practices. It explores several themes: (i) GIScience and the informatics revolution; (ii) the lack of a community-owned innovation platform for GIScience research; (iii) the computational limitations imposed by desktop computing and the inability to scale up analysis; (iv) the continued failure to support the temporal dimension, and especially dynamic processes and models with feedbacks; (v) the challenge of embracing a wider and more heterogeneous view of geographical representation and analysis; and (vi) the urgent need to foster an active software development community to redress some of these shortcomings. A brief discussion then summarizes the issues and suggests that GIScience needs to work harder as a community to become more relevant to the broader geographic field and meet a bigger set of representation, analysis, and modelling needs.},

There follows a discussion of how this 'composite commodity' definition relates to the planning challenge of spatially bounding neighbourhood. The paper then probes the myriad idiosyncrasies associated with the concept of neighbourhood: cross-attribute variation in durability and ability to be priced, relativistic evaluations of attributes and consumption impacts on attributes. It discusses how, within this new paradigmatic context, neighbourhoods are produced by the same actors that consume them: households, property owners, business people and local government. Finally, consideration is given to various aspects of the origins and nature of neighbourhood change and it is argued that neighbourhood dynamics are rife with social inefficiencies.},

The spatial scan statistic evaluates the significance of a series of potential circular clusters using Monte Carlo simulation to account for the multiplicity of comparisons. In most settings, the extent of the multiplicity problem varies across the study region. For example, urban areas typically have many overlapping clusters, while rural areas have few. The spatial scan statistic does not account for these local variations in the multiplicity problem. We propose two new spatially-varying multiplicity adjustments for spatial cluster detection, one based on a nested Bonferroni adjustment and one based on local averaging. Geographic variations in power for the spatial scan statistic and the two new statistics are explored through simulation studies, and the methods are applied to both the well-known New York leukemia data and data from a case{\textendash}control study of breast cancer in Wisconsin.},

These changes coincide with (1) an increase in housing prices in productive areas, (2) a divergence in the skill-specific real returns to living in productive places, (3) a redirection of low-skilled migration and (4) diminished human capital convergence due to migration. We develop a model where falling housing supply elasticity and endogenous labor mobility generates these patterns. Using a new panel measure of housing supply regulations, we demonstrate the importance of this channel. Income convergence continues in less-regulated places, while it has stopped in more-regulated places.},

This paper shows that the Gini index, G, underestimates the rate of increase in inequality because a shift of income towards the top incomes increases both the numerator and denominator of G. A modified index (G{$<$}formula{$>\_$}2{$<$}/formula{$>$}), which replaces the mean in the denominator by the median, indicates that income inequality in the United States grew at about twice the rate as the Gini index from 1967 to 2012. The analysis accounts for the effect of the changes made in the survey collection process in 1994. In contrast with the United States, while income inequality increased in Sweden, the shift in favor of the upper income region was less pronounced. The index G{$<$}formula{$>\_$}2{$<$}/formula{$>$} is readily computed from the mean, median and Gini index, published by many national statistical agencies. Although G{$<$}formula{$>\_$}2{$<$}/formula{$>$} may not be appropriate for some analytic purposes, it is an easily calculated summary descriptive measure that is more sensitive to important changes in the income distribution than the Gini index. Most other indices placing greater weight on the upper end of the income distribution must be calculated from micro-data.},

  abstract = {Growing regional inequality within countries has raised the perception that ``some places and people'' are left behind. This has prompted a shift toward inward-looking policies and away from pro-growth reforms. This paper presents novel stylized facts on regional inequality for OECD countries. It shows that regional disparity in per-capita GDP is large (even after adjusting for regional price differences), persistent, and widening over time. The paper also finds that rising nationwide income inequality is associated with both rising within-region income inequality and widening average income across regions. The rise in inequality is related to declining incentives for interregional labor mobility, especially for poor households in lagging regions, which are estimated to reduce by as much as one-third in the United States. Against these facts, the paper proposes a framework to identify whether, how and by whom fiscal policies can be used to tackle regional inequality. It outlines conditions under which those policies should be spatially-targeted and illustrates how they can be complementary to conventional meanstesting methods in mitigating income inequality.},

In such cases, one option is to use an open-source linear programming solver. A survey of linear programming tools was conducted to identify potential open-source solvers. From this survey, four open-source solvers were tested using a collection of linear programming test problems and the results were compared to IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer (CPLEX) [1], an industry standard. The solvers considered were: COIN-OR Linear Programming (CLP) [2], [3], GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) [4], lp\_solve [5] and Modular In-core Nonlinear Optimization System (MINOS) [6]. As no open-source solver outperforms CPLEX, this study demonstrates the power of commercial linear programming software. CLP was found to be the top performing open-source solver considered in terms of capability and speed. GLPK also performed well but cannot match the speed of CLP or CPLEX. lp\_solve and MINOS were considerably slower and encountered issues when solving several test problems.},

  abstract = {Maps are frequently used to display spatial distributions of parameters of interest, such as cancer rates or average pollutant concentrations by county. It is well known that plotting observed rates can have serious drawbacks when sample sizes vary by area, since very high (and low) observed rates are found disproportionately in poorly-sampled areas. Unfortunately, adjusting the observed rates to account for the e ects of small-sample noise can introduce an opposite e ect, in which the highest adjusted rates tend to be found disproportionately in well-sampled areas. In either case, the maps can be di cult to interpret because the display of spatial variation in the underlying parameters of interest is confounded with spatial variation in sample sizes. As a result, spatial patterns occur in adjusted rates even if there is no spatial structure in the underlying parameters of interest, and adjusted rates tend to look too uniform in areas with little data. We introduce two models (normal and Poisson) in which parameters of interest have no spatial patterns, and demonstrate the existence of spatial artefacts in inference from these models. We also discuss spatial models and the extent to which they are subject to the same artefacts. We present examples from Bayesian modelling, but, as we explain, the artefacts occur generally.

  abstract = {Maps of disease rates (and other quantities) often must contend with variance associated with variable population sizes and low incidence within spatial units. These characteristics can lead to substantial statistical noise that can mask underlying spatial variation. As Gelman and Price illustrated, most conventional mapping methods fail to address this problem, and in fact can introduce statistical artefacts; mapped quantities can show spatial patterns even when there are no spatial patterns in the underlying parameter of interest. Kafadar evaluated the performance of the headbanging algorithm for spatial smoothing (Tukey and Tukey, Hansen) for eliminating small scale variation and preserving edge structure. Here we perform a simulation study to investigate the artefacts of maps smoothed by unweighted and weighted headbanging. We {\"y}nd substantial artefacts that depend on the spatial structure of the statistical variation (for example, the spatial pattern of sample sizes) and on the details of the spatial distribution of geographic units. The methods used here could readily be adapted to study other spatial smoothers; we choose headbanging because (i) it is an important method used in practice, and (ii) its heavily computational nature is naturally studied using simulation (in contrast to the analytical methods used by Gelman and Price).

We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation.

Within the literature adopting the distribution dynamics approach, authors typically opt for spatial prefiltering. We follow an alternative route and propose a procedure based on an estimate of the mean function of a conditional density for which we develop a two-stage non-parametric estimator that allows for spatial dependence estimated via a spline estimator of the spatial correlation function. The finite sample performance of this estimator is assessed via Monte Carlo simulations. We apply the procedure that incorporates the proposed spatial non-parametric estimator to data on per capita personal income in US states and metropolitan statistical areas.},

The model projects of cial government labor force statistics to small subgroups of the population, enabling granular analysis of the labor force, conditional on the model's assumptions. It works by using a modi cation of multilevel regression and poststrati cation (MRP) to estimate the relationship between demographics, geography, and labor force statistics in the Current Population Survey (CPS), paying particular attention to demographically adjusted geographic predictors of industry, occupation, and recent employment status. These relationships are projected to a synthetically built, full national joint distribution at state, county, and census tract levels. Multiple stages of adjustment are used to ensure close proximity to of cial sources like the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) division and the of cial CPS numbers. The model is currently implemented down to the census-tract-by-demographic level, producing a complete national database of inferred labor force participation, employment, and ``at work'' status (without seasonal adjustment). The model uses 100\% publicly available government data, and code will be made available to expedite analysis of the labor force in response to COVID-19 and model improvement. In this paper, we describe the model's assumptions and steps in detail, and we provide examples of how it can be used to facilitate deep examination and analysis of the labor force.},

Worse, in many cases, such an approach will be uninformative about the causal economic processes at work, rendering much applied spatial econometric research ``pointless,'' unless the main aim is description of the data. We advocate an alternative approach based on the ``experimentalist paradigm'' which puts issues of identification and causality at center stage.},

However, higher test scores could signal higher academic value-added or higher ability, more sought-after intakes. In our research, we show that both school value-added and student prior achievement {\textendash} linked to the background of children in schools {\textendash} affect households' demand for education. In order to identify these effects, we improve the boundary discontinuity regression methodology by matching identical properties across admissions authority boundaries; by allowing for boundary effects and spatial trends; by re-weighting our data towards transactions that are closest to district boundaries; by eliminating boundaries that coincide with major geographical features; and by submitting our estimates to a number of novel falsification tests. Our results survive this battery of tests and show that a one-standard deviation change in either school average value-added or prior achievement raises prices by around 3\%.},

However, big data will not solve large urban social science questions on its own. Big urban data has the most value for the study of cities when it allows measurement of the previously opaque, or when it can be coupled with exogenous shocks to people or place. We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting that similar imagery data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured areas of the developing world. We then discuss how survey techniques can be improved to better measure willingness to pay for urban amenities. Finally, we explain how Internet data is being used to improve the quality of city services.},

  abstract = {Measuring regional inequality: to weight or not to weight? Spatial Economic Analysis. When estimating regional inequality, many economists use inequality indices weighted by regions' proportion of the national population. Although this approach is widespread, its adequacy has not received attention in the regional science literature. This paper proves that such an approach is conceptually inconsistent, yielding an estimate of interpersonal inequality among the whole population of the country rather than an estimate of regional inequality. Nevertheless, as a measure of interpersonal inequality, such an estimate is very rough (even misleading) and does not always have an intuitive interpretation. Moreover, population-weighted inequality indices do not meet the requirements for an adequate measure of inequality.},

  abstract = {Geocoding systems typically use more than one geographic reference dataset to improve match rates and spatial accuracy, resulting in multiple candidate geocodes from which the single ``best'' result must be selected. Little scientific evidence exists for formalizing this selection process or comparing one strategy to another, leading to the approach used in existing systems which we term the hierarchy-based criterion: place the available reference data layers into qualitative, static, and in many cases, arbitrary hierarchies and attempt a match in each layer, in order. The first non-ambiguous match with suitable confidence is selected and returned as output. This approach assumes global relationships of relative accuracy between reference data layers, ignoring local variations that could be exploited to return more precise geocodes. We propose a formalization of the selection criteria and present three alternative strategies which we term the uncertainty-, gravitationally-, and topologically-based strategies. The performance of each method is evaluated against two ground truth datasets of nationwide GPS points to determine any resulting spatial improvements. We find that any of the three new methods improves on current practice in the majority of cases. The gravitationally- and topologicallybased approaches offer improvement over a simple uncertainty-based approach in cases with specific characteristics.},

This study used longitudinal data from the NELS to see whether neighborhoods' or schools' proportion black and/or Latino during the high school years influences educational attainment through age 26. The analyses indicate that concentrations of blacks and Latinos in schools, but not zip code areas, associates with lower attainment in the long run. Students in predominantly black and Latino schools are less likely to earn a high school diploma or equivalent and to earn a bachelor's degree or more than similar students in predominantly white schools.

  abstract = {Geographic representation has become more complex through time as researchers have added new concepts, leading to apparently endless proliferation and creating a need for simplification. We show that many of these concepts can be derived from a single foundation that we term the atomic form of geographic information. The familiar concepts of continuous fields and discrete objects can be derived under suitable rules applied to the properties and values of the atomic form. Fields and objects are further integrated through the concept of phase space, and in the form of field objects. A second atomic concept is introduced, termed the geo-dipole, and shown to provide a foundation for object fields, metamaps, and the association classes of object-oriented data modelling. Geographic dynamics are synthesized in a three-dimensional space defined by static or dynamic object shape, the possibility of movement, and the possibility of dynamic internal structure. The atomic form also provides a tentative argument that discrete objects and continuous fields are the only possible bases for geographic representation.},

  abstract = {Introduction and Aims: This study examined whether the introduction of a large number of off-premise alcohol outlets into a city over a brief period of time could affect rates of violent crime. Design and Methods: The study analysed annual counts of violent crime across 172 US Census block groups in Lubbock, Texas from 2006 through 2011. Spatial Poisson models related annual violent crime counts within each block group to off-premise and on-premise alcohol outlets active during this time period as well as neighbourhood socio-demographic characteristics. The effects of alcohol outlets were assessed both within block groups and across adjacent block groups. Results: On-premise outlets had a small, significant positive association with violence within a given block group. A similar well-supported local effect for off-premise outlets was not found. However, the spatially lagged effect for off-sale premises was well-supported, indicating that greater densities of these outlets were related to greater rates of violent crime in adjacent areas. Discussion and Conclusions: While these analyses confirmed a previous time-series analysis in finding no city-wide effect of the increase in off-premise outlets, they do suggest that such outlets in a local area may be related to violence in nearby geographic areas. They indicate the importance of examining neighbourhood-specific effects of alcohol outlets on violence in addition to the city-wide effects. They also present further evidence supporting the need to examine the differential effects of on-sale and off-sale premises.},

The research aims to strike a balance between economic growth and environmental protection by distinguishing between sustainable and non-sustainable energy use and exploring their spatial impact on the environment. To ensure statistical robustness, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to eliminate multicollinearity, and a Spatially Lagged X Model (SLX) was employed to identify the significant factors influencing a country's ecological footprint. The results of the SLX regression demonstrate that the Green Economic Development and Unsustainable Urbanization factors have a significant effect on a country's ecological footprint. An increase in the Green Economic Development factor indicates that countries with rapid economic growth tend to overuse natural resources. Conversely, the Unsustainable Urbanization factor emphasizes the significance of population density and consumption of traditional energy sources in addressing environmental degradation. Additionally, the spatial dependency analysis underscores the importance of taking into account a country's neighbors' policies and actions alongside its own. This finding emphasizes the need for regional and global cooperation in addressing environmental challenges and achieving sustainable development goals. Overall, the research findings offer valuable insights for shaping policies and initiatives aimed at advancing sustainable development and mitigating environmental degradation. "}

  abstract = {Data primitives are the fundamental measurements or variables that capture the process under investigation. In this study annual data for small areas were collated and used to identify and characterise gentrification. Such data-driven approaches are possible because of the increased availability of data over small areas for fine spatial and temporal resolutions. They overcome limitations of traditional approaches to quantifying geodemographic change. This study uses annual data for 2010{\textendash}2019 of House Price, Professional Occupation, Residential Mobility (in and out flows) and Ethnicity over small areas, Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs). Areas of potential gentrification were identified from directional changes found in all of these variables, across combinations of start and end time periods. The initial set of areas were further processed and filtered to select robust gentrification cycles with minimum duration, and to determine start, peak and end years. Some 123 neighbourhoods in a regional case study area were found to have undergone some form of potential gentrification. These were examined further to characterise their spatial context and nature of the gentrification present, and specific types of gentrification were found to have specific periodicities. For example short-length durations (three to four years) were typically located in rural and suburban areas, associated with transit-induced cycles of gentrification, and greenification. Seven neighbourhoods were validated in detail, confirming the gentrification process and its type and their multivariate change vectors were examined. These showed that vector angle reflects the main data primitive driving the cycle of gentrification, which could aid with future prediction of gentrification cycles. A number of areas of further work are discussed.},

We compare the association between family income and sons' earnings in the United States (National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979), Britain (British Cohort Study 1970), and Sweden (Population Register Data, 1965 cohort), and find that both income elasticities and rank-order correlations are highest in the United States, followed by Britain, with Sweden being clearly more equal. We ask whether differences in educational inequality and in return to qualifications can explain these cross-country differences. Surprisingly, we find that this is not the case, even though returns to education are higher in the United States. Instead, the low income mobility in the United States and Britain is almost entirely due to the part of the parent-son association that is not mediated by educational attainment. In the United States and especially Britain, parental income is far more important for earnings at a given level of education than in Sweden, a result that holds also when controlling for cognitive ability. This goes against widespread ideas of the United States as a country where the role of ascription is limited and meritocratic stratification prevails.},

  abstract = {Fuzzy geographically weighted clustering has been proposed as an approach for improving fuzzy c-means algorithm when applied to geodemographic analysis. This clustering method allows a spatial entity to belong to more than one cluster with varying degrees, namely, membership values. Although fuzzy geographically weighted clustering attempts to create geographically aware clusters, it partially fails to trace spatial dependence and heterogeneity because, as a global metric, the membership values are calculated across the entire set of spatial entities. Here we introduce the first local version of fuzzy geographically weighted clustering, `local fuzzy geographically weighted clustering.' In local fuzzy geographically weighted clustering, the membership values of a spatial entity are updated only according to the membership values of the spatial entities within its neighborhood and not across the entire set of entities, as originally proposed by the global metric. Additionally, we apply particle swarm optimization meta-heuristic to overcome the random initialization problem regarding the fuzzy c-means algorithm. To evaluate our method we compare local fuzzy geographically weighted clustering to global fuzzy geographically weighted clustering using a cancer incident benchmark dataset for Manhattan, New York. The results show that local fuzzy geographically weighted clustering outperforms the global version in all experimental settings.},

Intuitively speaking, when zero spatial autocorrelation prevails, n{\~A} {$\frac{1}{4}$} n; when perfect positive spatial autocorrelation prevails in a univariate regional mean problem, n{\~A} {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1. Equations are presented for estimating n{\~A} based on the sampling distribution of a sample mean or sample correlation coefficient with the goal of obtaining some predetermined level of precision, using the following spatial statistical model specifications: (1) simultaneous autoregressive, (2) geostatistical semivariogram, and (3) spatial filter.

No effect is found of homeownership or neighbourhood characteristics on children's positive behaviour when the interaction between the two is not included in the model. However, homeownership was found to have a stronger positive effect on children's positive behaviour as neighbourhood population density increases and, at approximately 4000 persons per square mile (approximate population density of San Diego, CA), homeownership has a significant positive effect on children's overall scores on the positive behaviour scale.},

However, there are few studies of the relative merits of the methods available. While many Bayesian models have been examined with respect to prior sensitivity, it is clear that wider comparisons of methods are largely missing from the literature. In this paper we present some preliminary results concerning the goodness-of-fit of a variety of disease mapping methods to simulated data for disease incidence derived from a range of models. These simulated models cover simple risk gradients to more complex true risk structures, including spatial correlation. The main general results presented here show that the gamma-Poisson exchangeable model and the Besag, York and Mollie (BYM) model are most robust across a range of diverse models. Mixture models are less robust. Non-parametric smoothing methods perform badly in general. Linear Bayes methods display behaviour similar to that of the gamma-Poisson methods.

  abstract = {Background: Alcohol related violence continues to be a major public health problem in the United States. In particular, there is substantial evidence of an association between alcohol outlets and assault. However, because the specific geographic relationships between alcohol outlets and the distribution of violence remains obscured, it is important to identify the spatial linkages that may exist, enhancing public health efforts to curb both violence and morbidity.Methods: The present study utilizes police-recorded data on simple and aggravated assaults in Cincinnati, Ohio. Addresses of alcohol outlets for Cincinnati, including all bars, alcohol-serving restaurants, and off-premise liquor and convenience stores were obtained from the Ohio Division of Liquor Control and geocoded for analysis. A combination of proximity analysis, spatial cluster detection approaches and a geographic information system were used to identify clusters of alcohol outlets and the distribution of violence around them.Results: A brief review of the empirical work relating to alcohol outlet density and violence is provided, noting that the majority of this literature is cross-sectional and ecological in nature, yielding a somewhat haphazard and aggregate view of how outlet type(s) and neighborhood characteristics like social organization and land use are related to assaultive violence. The results of the statistical analysis for Cincinnati suggest that while alcohol outlets are not problematic per se, assaultive violence has a propensity to cluster around agglomerations of alcohol outlets. This spatial relationship varies by distance and is also related to the characteristics of the alcohol outlet agglomeration. Specifically, spatially dense distributions of outlets appear to be more prone to clusters of assaultive violence when compared to agglomerations with a lower density of outlets.Conclusion: With a more thorough understanding of the spatial relationships between alcohol outlets and the distribution of assaults, policymakers in urban areas can make more informed regulatory decisions regarding alcohol licenses. Further, this research suggests that public health officials and epidemiologists need to develop a better understanding of what actually occurs in and around alcohol outlets, determining what factors (whether outlet, neighborhood, or spatially related) help fuel their relationship with violence and other alcohol-related harm. {\textcopyright} 2011 Grubesic and Pridemore; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

  abstract = {Background: With Pennsylvania currently considering a move away from an Alcohol Beverage Control state to a privatized alcohol distribution system, this study uses a spatial analytical approach to examine potential impacts of privatization on the number and spatial distribution of alcohol outlets in the city of Philadelphia over a long time horizon. Methods. A suite of geospatial data were acquired for Philadelphia, including 1,964 alcohol outlet locations, 569,928 land parcels, and school, church, hospital, park and playground locations. These data were used as inputs for exploratory spatial analysis to estimate the expected number of outlets that would eventually operate in Philadelphia. Constraints included proximity restrictions (based on current ordinances regulating outlet distribution) of at least 200 feet between alcohol outlets and at least 300 feet between outlets and schools, churches, hospitals, parks and playgrounds. Results: Findings suggest that current state policies on alcohol outlet distributions in Philadelphia are loosely enforced, with many areas exhibiting extremely high spatial densities of outlets that violate existing proximity restrictions. The spatial model indicates that an additional 1,115 outlets could open in Philadelphia if privatization was to occur and current proximity ordinances were maintained. Conclusions: The study reveals that spatial analytical approaches can function as an excellent tool for contingency-based "what-if" analysis, providing an objective snapshot of potential policy outcomes prior to implementation. In this case, the likely outcome is a tremendous increase in alcohol outlets in Philadelphia, with concomitant negative health, crime and quality of life outcomes that accompany such an increase. {\textcopyright} 2012 Grubesic et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

Methods: Cross-sectional ecological study of 1816 block groups in Philadelphia.We obtained 2010 data for aggravated assaults, alcohol outlets, alcohol expenditures, business points, land use and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. We mapped the spatial distribution of alcohol outlets and aggravated assaults using a geographic informationsystem. We estimated the association between assault density and total, on-premise and off-premise alcohol outlet densities using spatial regression models and controlling for the covariates of urban crime rates, alcohol expenditures, and the presence of other general and risky commercial retail outlets. Results: The strong and positive association between alcohol outlet density and violence remained after controlling for alcohol expenditures and the density of other retailers. Conclusion: Findings support the concept that off-premise alcohol outlets in the neighborhood environment may impact health and social outcomes. The positive outlet-violence association in the face of these controls means it is not an association due solely to alcohol availability or to retail density. It also suggests that there is something unique about alcohol outlets or their density that makes them crime generators and links them to violence. copy; The Author 2013.

  abstract = {Background: A growing body of research recommends controlling alcohol availability to reduce harm. Various common approaches, however, provide dramatically different pictures of the physical availability of alcohol. This limits our understanding of the distribution of alcohol access, the causes and consequences of this distribution, and how best to reduce harm. The aim of this study is to introduce both a gravity potential measure of access to alcohol outlets, comparing its strengths and weaknesses to other popular approaches, and an empirically-derived taxonomy of neighborhoods based on the type of alcohol access they exhibit. Methods: We obtained geospatial data on Seattle, including the location of 2402 alcohol outlets, United States Census Bureau estimates on 567 block groups, and a comprehensive street network. We used exploratory spatial data analysis and employed a measure of inter-rater agreement to capture differences in our taxonomy of alcohol availability measures. Results: Significant statistical and spatial variability exists between measures of alcohol access, and these differences have meaningful practical implications. In particular, standard measures of outlet density (e.g., spatial, per capita, roadway miles) can lead to biased estimates of physical availability that over-emphasize the influence of the control variables. Employing a gravity potential approach provides a more balanced, geographically-sensitive measure of access to alcohol outlets. Conclusions: Accurately measuring the physical availability of alcohol is critical for understanding the causes and consequences of its distribution and for developing effective evidence-based policy to manage the alcohol outlet licensing process. A gravity potential model provides a superior measure of alcohol access, and the alcohol access-based taxonomy a helpful evidence-based heuristic for scholars and local policymakers.}

  abstract = {The implementation of regulations on access to alcoholic beverages, whether through beverage taxes or restrictions on the availability of this commodity through alcohol outlets, has often been proposed as a legitimate and politically feasible approach to the prevention of alcohol-related problems. Empirical studies of the effects of these approaches to regulation on alcohol consumption and problems, however, have not been unanimous in their support of these preventive measures. While support exists for the suggestion that increases in alcohol beverage prices reduce consumption and have preventive effects upon the occurrence of problems, relatively little evidence exists for the supposition that the regulation of alcohol availability will have similar preventive effects. The lack of evidence in support of the latter thesis rests primarily upon the difficulty of obtaining sufficient data to examine comprehensive models of access to alcohol. The current paper analyzes aggregate time series cross-sectional data from states of the U.S. to evaluate the relationships between alcohol beverage prices, availability, and alcohol sales within one analytic model. The model relates beverage prices and alcohol availability directly to alcohol sales in the context of an assumed simultaneous relationship between sales and availability. The results show that, independent of the effects of beverage prices, and controlling for the endogeneity of sales and availability, physical availability of alcohol was directly related to sales of spirits and wine.

  abstract = {Objective: This study examines the degree to which the physical availability of alcohol as measured by outlet densities is related to self-reported individual drinking patterns, preferred drinking location, as well as both driving after drinking (DAD) and driving while intoxicated (DWI). Method: Data from 7,826 drinkers were obtained from a general-population telephone survey of 1,353 zip code areas in California. Measures of individual alcohol consumption included drinking frequency, drinks per occasion and variance in quantities consumed per occasion. Preferred drinking locations included bars, restaurants and the homes of drinkers and of their friends. DAD was defined as driving a motor vehicle within 4 hours of having one or more alcoholic drinks, and DWI was defined as driving after having too much to drink and drive safely. Geographic measures of outlet densities were obtained for bars, restaurants and off-premises establishments, using zip codes as geographic units of analysis. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to relate outlet densities within and surrounding respondents' area of residence to respondents' drinking and to respondents' drinking and driving. Results: Whereas restaurant densities were directly related to greater drinking frequencies and DAD, bar densities were inversely related to DAD. There were no direct effects of drinking patterns on drinking and driving. Drinking and driving was strongly related to drinking location preference (e.g., bars and restaurants) only when considered simultaneously with individual drinking patterns, particularly drinking frequency. Conclusions: Increased restaurant density is strongly related to higher rates of both self-reported driving after drinking and drinking frequency. The strongest influence on both driving after drinking and driving while intoxicated is preferred drinking location considered together with individual drinking patterns. Outlet density and preferred drinking location when considered together with individual drinking patterns support driving after drinking and thereby increase the potential for alcohol-related accidents.}

  abstract = {Aims: Empirical tests of relationships between alcohol outlets and violence are generally conducted with statistical controls for correlates related to characteristics of people and the places in which they live. Crime potentials theory asserts that certain subpopulations are disposed to participate in criminal activities (population potentials) and certain neighborhoods are more likely to be places where crimes occur (place potentials). The current study assesses the degree to which measures of the different geographic distributions of these potentials contribute to violent crime. Design: Cross-sectional data on hospital discharges for violent assaults were obtained for residents of 1637 zip code areas in California. Assault rates were related to measures of population and place characteristics using spatial statistical models corrected for spatial autocorrelated error. Findings: Rates of assault were related to population and place characteristics within zip code areas, and with characteristics of populations living in adjacent zip code areas. Assault rates were greater in densely populated, poor minority urban areas with greater residential instability. Assault rates were also greater in zip code areas adjacent to densely populated urban areas. Assault rates were related significantly to local densities of off-premise alcohol retail establishments, not bars. However, densities of bars moderated substantially effects related to local population characteristics. Bars were related significantly to violence in unstable poor minority areas and in rural middle-income areas of the state. Conclusion: Population and place characteristics are associated with rates of violence across spatial areas. Alcohol outlets directly affect and moderate potentials for violence associated with socio-demographic groups. {\textcopyright} 2006 Society for the Study of Addiction.}

  abstract = {Aims: This paper summarizes several theoretical perspectives that serve to explain observed associations between concentrations of alcohol outlets and alcohol-related problems. A critique of each perspective discusses how each addresses the social etiology of these problems; that is, how, where and why these problems arise in association with alcohol outlets? Methods: This theoretical work is based upon mathematical and computational models of the ecology of alcohol-related problems developed in the 'Ecosystems Modeling Project', an advanced research project of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, United States. Results: Associations between outlets and problems are thought to arise from the concentration of individuals in drinking places ('flow models'), the attraction of some places for people at risk for problems ('gravity models'), or because outlets are located in high-risk neighborhoods and have negative social normative effects ('social contextual models'). None of these approaches explain how some outlets come to have more problems than others (e.g. violent outlets). An alternative social ecological model is introduced which asserts that the complementary processes of niche marketing and assortative drinking form the social dynamic that explains these relationships. Alcohol sellers 'niche market' to select social strata, drinkers return to establishments at which they find people like themselves, and consequent social stratification of the market-place increases the levels of related problems in some outlets. Conclusions: The proposed mechanism is very general, and suggests that over-concentrations of outlets will lead to stratification of drinking groups and intensification of problems related to those outlets. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.}

Dynamic monitoring of the spatio-temporal evolution of carbon emissions is an essential way to achieve carbon reduction goals, especially in coastal areas like Guangdong Province faced with dual challenges of massive carbon emissions and rigorous reduction targets. To reveal the spatio-temporal characteristics of carbon emissions and provide a basis for further fine-grained carbon emission reduction strategies, we analyzed spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of carbon emissions in Guangdong Province at the county-level scale from 2000 to 2020. Based on the land-use data obtained from the Data Center for Resources and Environmental Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and energy consumption data from the Statistical Yearbook, the carbon emission of each county is estimated, and the spatio-temporal evolutionary features of them are explored by a series of methods of the exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis (ESTDA). The shift of spatial distribution characteristics and gravity center is further revealed with the standard deviational ellipse and gravity center migration analysis.The results reveal that the net carbon emissions increased from 6179.229~{\texttimes}~104 tons to 20765.723~{\texttimes}~104 tons during 2000{\textendash}2020. The net carbon emissions of county-level administrative regions show a significant positive spatial correlation, and the spatial convergence shows a trend of first decreasing and then increasing. The spatio-temporal pattern of carbon emissions has an obvious path dependence and locked spatial features, and shows a gradually strengthening trend. The spatial distribution of carbon emissions formed a stable ``northeast-southwest'' pattern, and the gravity center of carbon emissions in the past 20~years has been distributed between 113.208{\textdegree}{\textendash}113.357{\textdegree}E and 22.760{\textdegree}{\textendash}22.878{\textdegree}N, tending slightly shifting to the northeast. The results of the study can help understand the spatio-temporal evolution of carbon emissions in Guangdong, and provide a reference for formulating effective carbon reduction policies.},

In this article we present the Stata command dseg for obtaining all of them. It contributes to the stock of segregation commands in Stata by (1) implementing in a single call the decomposition; (2) providing the weights and local indices employed in the computation of the within term; (3) facilitating the deployment of the decomposability properties of the eight indices in complex scenarios that demand tailor-made solutions; and (4) leveraging sample data with bootstrapping and approximate randomization tests. We analyze 2017 census data of public schools in the United States to illustrate the use of dseg. The subject topic is school racial segregation.},

  abstract = {Hotspot identification is an important step in the highway safety management process. Errors in hotspot identification (HSID) may result in an inefficient use of limited resources for safety improvements. The empirical Bayesian (EB) HSID has been widely applied as an effective approach in identifying hotspots. However, there are some limitations with the EB approach. It assumes that the parameter estimates of the safety performance function (SPF) are correct without any uncertainty, and does not consider temporal instability in crashes, which has been reported in recent studies. The Bayesian hierarchical model is an emerging technique that addresses the limitations of the EB method. Thus, the objective of this study is to compare the performance of the standard EB method and the Bayesian hierarchical model in identifying hotspots. Three methods (crash rate, EB, and the Bayesian hierarchical model) were applied to identify risky intersections with different significance levels. Four evaluation tests (site consistency, method consistency, total rank differences, and Poisson mean differences tests) were conducted to assess the performance of these three methods. The testing results suggest that: (1) the Bayesian hierarchical model outperforms the crash rate and the EB methods in most cases, and the Bayesian hierarchical model improves the accuracy of HSID significantly; and (2) hotspots identified with crash rates are generally unreliable. This is significant for roadway agencies and practitioners trying to accurately rank sites in the roadway network to effectively manage safety investments. Roadway agencies and practitioners are encouraged to consider the Bayesian hierarchical model in identifying hotspots.},

Modelling at a regional scale may allow the identification of solutions that optimize both accuracy and generality. However, most current regionalization algorithms assume homogeneity in the attributes to delineate regions without considering the processes that generate the attributes. In this paper, we propose a generalized regionalization framework based on a two-item objective function which favors solutions with the highest overall accuracy while minimizing the number of regions. We introduce three regionalization algorithms, which extend previous methods that account for spatially constrained clustering. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is examined in regression experiments on both simulated and real data. The results show that a spatially implicit algorithm extended with an automatic post-processing procedure outperforms spatially explicit approaches. Our suggested framework contributes to better capturing the processes associated with spatial heterogeneity with potential applications in a wide range of geographical models.},

  abstract = {The segregation of secondary school students into different schools has important implications for educational inequality, social cohesion and intergenerational mobility. Previous research has demonstrated how between-school segregation varies significantly across countries, with high levels of segregation occurring in central European nations that `track' children into different schools and much lower levels in Scandinavia. This paper contributes to this literature by examining whether industrialised countries have made any progress in reducing levels of between-school segregation over time. Using six waves of data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), this work shows how the segregation of rich and poor students has remained broadly unchanged across OECD countries. This is despite major economic and political events occurring during this period, along with the introduction of numerous policy initiatives designed to reduce socioeconomic gaps. Therefore, the conclusions indicate that structural factors are likely to be the main drivers of between-school segregation (e.g. neighbourhood segregation or long-standing school admission policies) and that education policymakers may need to be much more radical if they are to foster greater levels of integration between the rich and the poor.},

These data were matched with information on population and race from the 1990 census in order to document which geographic areas of the city, if any, had excess tobacco or alcohol billboards. The data revealed that minority wards were burdened with three times as many tobacco billboards and five times as many alcohol billboards when compared to white wards. The findings are congruent with studies conducted in other urban areas, which demonstrate a consistent pattern of tobacco and alcohol advertisers targeting poor and minority neighborhoods for outdoor advertising of their dangerous products. Chicago legislative initiatives based on the billboard study are described. {\textcopyright} 1995 Journal of Public Health Policy, Inc.},

  abstract = {"Freewaytopia: How Freeways Shaped Los Angeles explores how social, economic, political, and cultural demands created the web of expressways whose very form--futuristic, majestic, and progressive--perfectly exemplifies the City of Angels. From the Arroyo Seco, which began construction during the Great Depression, to the Simi Valley and Century Freeways, which were completed in 1993, author Paul Haddad provides an entertaining and engaging history of the 527 miles of road that comprise the Los Angeles freeway system. Each of Los Angeles's twelve freeways receives its own chapter, and these are supplemented by "Off-Ramps"--Sidebars that dish out pithy factoids about Botts' Dots, SigAlerts, and all matter of freeway lexicon, such as why Southern Californians are the only people in the country who place the word "the" in front of their interstates, as in "the 5," or "the 101." Freewaytopia also explores those routes that never saw the light of day. Imagine superhighways burrowing through Laurel Canyon, tunneling under the Hollywood Sign, or spanning the waters of Santa Monica Bay. With a few more legislative strokes of the pen, you wouldn't have to imagine them--they'd already exist. Haddad notably gives voice to those individuals whose lives were inextricably connected--for better or worse--to the city's freeways: The hundreds of thousands of mostly minority and lower-class residents who protested against their displacement as a result of eminent domain. Women engineers who excelled in a man's field. Elected officials who helped further freeways ... or stop them dead in their tracks. And he pays tribute to the corps of civic and state highway employees whose collective vision, expertise, and dedication created not just the most famous freeway network in the world, but feats of engineering that, at their best, achieve architectural poetry. Finally, let's not forget the beauty queens--no freeway in Los Angeles ever opened without their royal presence."-- Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {Choropleth mapping is an essential visualization technique for exploratory spatial data analysis. Visualizing multiple choropleth maps is a technique that spatial analysts use to reveal spatiotemporal patterns of one variable or to compare the geographical distributions of multiple variables. Critical features for effective exploration of multiple choropleth maps are (1) automated computation of the same class intervals for shading different choropleth maps, (2) dynamic visualization of local variation in a variable, and (3) linking for synchronous exploration of multiple choropleth maps. Since the 1990s, these features have been developed and are now included in many commercial geographic information system (GIS) software packages. However, many choropleth mapping tools include only one or two of the three features described above. On the other hand, freely available mapping tools that support side-by-side multiple choropleth map visualizations are usually desktop software only. As a result, most existing tools supporting multiple choropleth-map visualizations cannot be easily integrated with Web-based and open-source data visualization libraries, which have become mainstream in visual analytics and geovisualization. To fill this gap, we introduce an open-source Web-based choropleth mapping tool called the Adaptive Choropleth Mapper (ACM), which combines the three critical features for flexible choropleth mapping.},

The student samples for this study were collected from an online travel diary survey conducted by Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan. The ArcGIS Network Analyst was used to construct spatial network datasets and reconstruct trajectories from the origin{\textendash}destination trip dataset. In addition, line densities of estimated trajectories were calculated and displayed on maps for geovisualization. These maps helped us understand the precise locations of congestion and spatial patterns of student commuting, unlike linear representations of people's movements that connect origins and destinations. Our study also showed that estimated trajectories can simulate quantitative impacts on travel time by promoting walking or the use of public transportation.},

  abstract = {We present an outline of relative distribution methods, with an application to recent changes in the U.S. wage distribution. Relative distribution methods are a nonparametric statistical framework for analyzing data in a fully distributional context. The framework combines the graphical tools of exploratory data analysis with statistical summaries, decomposition, and inference. The relative distribution is similar to a density ratio. It is technically defined as the random variable obtained by transforming a variable from a comparison group by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of that variable for a reference group. This transformation produces a set of observations, the relative data, that represent the rank of the original comparison value in terms of the reference group's CDF. The density and CDF of the relative data can therefore be used to fully represent and analyze distributional differences. Analysis can move beyond comparisons of means and variances to tap the detailed information inherent in distributions. The analytic framework is general and flexible, as the relative density is decomposable into the effect of location and shape differences, and into effects that represent both compositional changes in covariates, and changes in the covariate-outcome variable relationship.},

  abstract = {Texas, 1921. A time of abundance. The Great War is over, the bounty of the land is plentiful, and America is on the brink of a new and optimistic era. But for Elsa Wolcott, deemed too old to marry in a time when marriage is a woman's only option, the future seems bleak. Until the night she meets Rafe Martinelli and decides to change the direction of her life. With her reputation in ruin, there is only one respectable choice: marriage to a man she barely knows. By 1934, the world has changed; millions are out of work and drought has devastated the Great Plains. Farmers are fighting to keep their land and their livelihoods as crops fail and water dries up and the earth cracks open. Dust storms roll relentlessly across the plains. Everything on the Martinelli farm is dying, including Elsa's tenuous marriage; each day is a desperate battle against nature and a fight to keep her children alive. In this uncertain and perilous time, Elsa--like so many of her neighbors--must make an agonizing choice: fight for the land she loves or leave it behind and go west, to California, in search of a better life for her family. The Four Winds is a rich, sweeping novel that stunningly brings to life the Great Depression and the people who lived through it--the harsh realities that divided a nation and the enduring battle between the haves and the have-nots. A testament to hope, resillience, and the strength of the human spirit to survive adversity, The Four Winds is an indelible portrait of America and the American Dream, as seen through the eyes of one indomitable woman whose courage and sacrifice will come to define a generation. --},

  abstract = {GWR is a popular approach for investigating the spatial variation in relationships between response and predictor variables, and critically for investigating and understanding process spatial heterogeneity. The geographically weighted (GW) framework is increasingly used to accommodate different types of models and analyses reflecting a wider desire to explore spatial variation in model parameters or components. However, the growth in the use of GWR and different GW models has only been partially supported by package development in both R and Python, the major coding environments for spatial analysis. The result is that refinements have been inconsistently included (if at all) within GWR and GW functions in any given package. This paper outlines the structure of a new gwverse package, that will over time replace GWmodel, that takes advantage of recent developments in the composition of complex, integrated packages. It conceptualises gwverse as having a modular structure, that separates core GW functionality and applications such as GWR. It adopts a function factory approach, in which bespoke functions are created and returned to the user based on user-defined parameters. The paper introduces two demonstrator modules that can be used to undertake GWR and identifies a number of key considerations and next steps.},

  abstract = {Social disorganization theory is a macro-level approach to understanding variation in levels of neighborhood crime and delinquency. Contemporary studies of social disorganization typically rely on administratively defined geographic boundaries (i.e., census blocks, block groups, or tracts) and demographic data aggregated to corresponding areas as proxies for neighborhoods and neighborhood conditions. Despite their frequent use, it is unknown whether official measures of neighborhoods and corresponding measures of neighborhood conditions are valid indicators of these concepts. Using data from a survey of 116 residents of Clark County, Nevada, the current study tests the validity of commonly used measures of neighborhood boundaries and neighborhood structural conditions in the context of social disorganization theory. Results show that administrative proxies of neighborhoods are inconsistent with perceived neighborhood boundaries and that perceived neighborhood structural determinants of social disorganization are also inconsistent with official measures. Findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications and direction for future research.},

We often think of mathematics and literature as polar opposites, as different as they come. But what if, instead, they were inextricably, even fundamentally, linked? In her clear, insightful, laugh-out-loud funny debut, Once Upon a Prime, Professor Sarah Hart shows us the myriad connections between math and literature, and how understanding those connections can enhance our enjoyment of both. Did you know, for instance, that Moby-Dick is full of sophisticated geometry? That James Joyce's stream-of-consciousness novels are deliberately checkered with mathematical references? That George Eliot was obsessed with statistics? That Jurassic Park is undergirded by fractal patterns? That Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie wrote mathematician characters? From sonnets to fairytales to experimental French literature, Professor Hart shows how math and literature are complementary parts of the same quest, to understand human life and our place in the universe. As the first woman to hold England's oldest mathematical chair, Professor Hart is the ideal tour guide, taking us on an unforgettable journey through the books we thought we knew, revealing new layers of beauty and wonder.

Research suggests that youth disconnection can have negative consequences on youths' well-being, their communities, and the economy at large. The existing literature however neglects the underlying socio-demographic and economic factors that systematically contribute to the cause of youth disconnection in the United States. This study aims to explore the characteristics associated with youth disconnection and their spatially varying effects in different regions across the contiguous United States. Using data from the 2015 to 2019 5-year American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample, results suggest that areas with higher percentages of OY are located in the Sunbelt region (e.g., southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia). Moreover, a multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) analysis illustrated spatially varying relationships with disconnection, demonstrating that factors have unique effects across different geographic areas. The potential impact of intersectionality for OY by race and ethnicity, ability, nationality, language, income, and parenting status is discussed. These results highlight the influence of local contexts in creating and reinforcing youth disconnection as well as informing responses to local support services for OY.},

The first involves the transition to a knowledge economy where the most lucrative industry is now the production and management of information or ``data''. ``Data'' is the new ``oil'' of our age (The Economist, 2017). The second significant transformation is the transition from a rural to an urban world, a process known as urbanisation. Today most people live in cities (United Nations, 2014). As the world has crossed these thresholds, there are new opportunities to address wicked policy problems such as environmental degradation, migration and climate change, through data-assisted solutions. This book endeavours to provide sound evidence and case studies to support renegotiating the terms for information exchange, ownership and data use in cities for the benefit of urban citizens. In other words, this book is about the best use of the world's most valuable economic commodity{\textendash}data{\textemdash}and how it can be used to assist the planetary transition to sustainable, productive, resilient and liveable urban futures.},

The scientific data on temperature, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, sea-level rise and global warming forms the evidence base for global climate agreements. Global scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change and the global policies' emphasis on Open Data to meet climate goals have motivated the world to implement Open Data policies. However, the existing Open Data initiatives for climate action largely focus on continental regions and nation states rather than urban areas. A new paradigm of city-level Open Data initiatives is needed to ensure that societies can develop place-based actions to moderate climate change. This is because global climate change has drastic consequences for cities. In this chapter, we review the relevance of Open Data in urban vulnerability management and empowering cities as `centres of action'. We aim to unpack this relationship through the heat vulnerability index platform that we have developed using accessible public data. We use Sydney's vulnerability to heat waves as a case study to demonstrate the index and its function as a powerful adaptation planning support tool.},

Land use, often measured by population density, has been shown to have a significant effect on the length and frequency of travel. We present amenity consumption as an alternative perspective to this analysis, where it is assumed that individuals make trade-offs between spending time and money on activities. A causal identification strategy is proposed for the relationship between population density and amenity consumption based on geological features and historical population densities. Our analysis is based on a national sample of household expenditures for the United States. We measure amenity consumption as out-of-home entertainment and food, transit services, and replacement of home production. We find the strongest effect of density is on transit consumption. We also consider historical trends, which offer the critical forecasting insight that the relative distribution of consumption among aggregate categories has been relatively stable since the 1980s.}

Despite significant spatial agglomeration at all spatial scales, the extent of agglomeration shows an obviously downward trend from 2003 to 2006. Substantially stronger agglomeration of economic development is demonstrated at county scales. Local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) are employed to visualize the local spatial characteristics of economic growth. Four snapshots (in the years 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2010) of LISA indicate a dramatic north-shifting of hot spots of economic growth in response to the northward movement of foreign investors and spatial agglomeration besides institutional forces in China. Furthermore, local spatial agglomeration demonstrates a heterogeneous process: hot spots of economic development along the coast, cold spots in western China and no significant spatial clusters in central China. As the major carries of scale economies, metropolitan regions see decreasing internal agglomeration during this period with the exception of the Yangtze River Delta area, which shows a strong spatial spillover into its neighbourhood. Finally, LISA Markov and geovisualization methods are employed to predict the long-run properties of spatial distribution in multi-scalar China. The results show that downward co-movements of a county with its neighbours are more frequently encountered, perhaps resulting in the continuous concentration of poor areas in the long run.},

  abstract = {Global trade in commodities has become an important driver of environmental degradation. In response, there has been a proliferation of nonstate, market-driven governance seeking to reduce environmental degradation through interventions in the supply chain. We provide some of the first quasiexperimental evidence to show that private, market-driven policies can slow deforestation. We compare the impacts of two certification schemes and a deforestation moratorium in Chile using a factorial quasiexperimental design. Our results indicate that governance regimes with greater collaboration between environmental and industry stakeholders achieved better environmental outcomes. In contrast to many public conservation policies, we find that private governance systems can effectively target high-deforestation properties.Global markets for agricultural products, timber, and minerals are critically important drivers of deforestation. The supply chains driving land use change may also provide opportunities to halt deforestation. Market campaigns, moratoria, and certification schemes have been promoted as powerful tools to achieve conservation goals. Despite their promise, there have been few opportunities to rigorously quantify the ability of these nonstate, market-driven (NSMD) governance regimes to deliver conservation outcomes. This study analyzes the impacts of three NSMD governance systems that sought to end the conversion of natural forests to plantations in Chile at the start of the 21st century. Using a multilevel, panel dataset of land use changes in Chile, we identify the impact of participation within each of the governance regimes by implementing a series of matched difference-in-differences analyses. Taking advantage of the mosaic of different NSMD regimes adopted in Chile, we explore the relative effectiveness of different policies. NSMD governance regimes reduced deforestation on participating properties by 2{\textendash}23\%. The NSMD governance regimes we studied included collaborative and confrontational strategies between environmental and industry stakeholders. We find that the more collaborative governance systems studied achieved better environmental performance than more confrontational approaches. Whereas many government conservation programs have targeted regions with little likelihood of conversion, we demonstrate that NSMD governance has the potential to alter behavior on high-deforestation properties.},

Spatial extensions of the Carlino and Mills's 1987 and Boarnet's 1994 models are estimated to analyze the spread of population and employment into 3,500 rural communes in six French regions. Results are compared for the Henry, Barkley, and Bao's 1997 extension of the Boarnet model, the Carlino-Mills and Boarnet models, and three spatial autoregressive models suggested by Rey and Boarnet in 1998. Tests for spread and backwash effects in the spatial autoregressive model, and the Carlino-Mills and Boarnet models, with spatial autoregressive terms added, indicate that population growth spreads to rural communities from nearby areas but that evidence on employment spread is less robust. The Henry et al. modification to Boarnet adds insight into how urban growth affects proximate rural areas by decomposing the spatial cross-regressive term into rural area, urban core, and urban fringe effects.},

  abstract = {Qualitative methods potentially add depth to prevention research, but can produce large amounts of complex data even with small samples. Studies conducted with culturally distinct samples often produce voluminous qualitative data, but may lack sufficient sample sizes for sophisticated quantitative analysis. Currently lacking in mixed methods research are methods allowing for more fully integrating qualitative and quantitative analysis techniques. Cluster analysis can be applied to coded qualitative data to clarify the findings of prevention studies by aiding efforts to reveal such things as the motives of participants for their actions and the reasons behind counterintuitive findings. By clustering groups of participants with similar profiles of codes in a quantitative analysis, cluster analysis can serve as a key component in mixed methods research., This article reports two studies. In the first study, we conduct simulations to test the accuracy of cluster assignment using three different clustering methods with binary data as produced when coding qualitative interviews. Results indicated that hierarchical clustering, K-Means clustering, and latent class analysis produced similar levels of accuracy with binary data, and that the accuracy of these methods did not decrease with samples as small as 50. Whereas the first study explores the feasibility of using common clustering methods with binary data, the second study provides a ``real-world'' example using data from a qualitative study of community leadership connected with a drug abuse prevention project. We discuss the implications of this approach for conducting prevention research, especially with small samples and culturally distinct communities.},

Multiple spatial regression models were used to explore the ecological risk factors potentially associated with the spatial variations of the epidemic. The results suggest an overall clustered pattern of opioid overdoses with all overdose incidents concentrated in less than 8\% of all the street segments. The consecutive hot spots largely overlapped with the most disadvantaged inner-city neighborhoods in Louisville. Regression results provided statistical evidence regarding the effects of socioeconomic correlates including uninsured, vacancy rates, and criminal activity. The spatial discrepancy between the overdose hot spots and lack of medical facilities or hospitals in the disadvantaged neighborhoods points to the critical issue of health inequity.},

Researchers have consistently argued that HOLC caused redlining and disinvestment in U.S. cities by sharing its color-coded maps. Geographic information systems and spatial statistical models were used to analyze address-level mortgage data from Philadelphia to determine if areas with worse grades actually had less access to residential mortgage credit as a result. Findings indicate that the grades on HOLC's map do not explain differences in lending patterns with the exception of interest rates, which were higher in areas colored red. Archival material and journal articles from the 1930s also reveal that lenders were avoiding areas colored red before HOLC made its maps, that HOLC's maps were not widely distributed, and that lenders had other sources of information about real estate risk levels.},

This article considers why HOLC made these maps, how HOLC created them, and what the basis was for the grades on the maps. Geographic information systems and spatial regression models are used to show that racial composition was a significant predictor of map grades, controlling for housing characteristics.},

Longitudinal growth models revealed that Head Start children began their academic careers well below their more advantaged peers in literacy and mathematics, although by the end of first grade, their scores were nearly on par with national averages. Demographic characteristics of children, as well as their early language and social skills, were the strongest predictors of children's initial status and growth in both early academic domains.

The authors use data from wave I (2001) of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (n = 3,570) to aggregate respondents into egohoods of two different sizes: quarter-mile and half-mile radii. Consistent with expectations, neighborhoods with higher levels of general social distance have higher variability in reports of neighboring and the two components of collective efficacy, cohesion and informal social control.},

We apply this framework to study 329 US metropolitan regions based on 1 sq km. grid cells. We find diverse trajectories of metropolitan restructuring between 2000 and 2010, and substantial variation across regions in employment concentration. The new framework enables researchers to compare metropolitan regions to gain insights into the dynamic nature of metropolitan spatial structure.},

GIS is typically represented as a singular, infallibly objective, and universally applicable technology. GIS generally dismisses the critiques from human geography, while critical human geography dismisses GIS for its association with positivism and unethical applications. Teaching critical open GIS may bridge this divide, creating a transformative pedagogical space for human geography to affectively and effectively engage with open GIS technology at the level of code. Critical open GIS students practice and critique GIS as conflicted insiders, bridging the divide between GIS and non-GIS in their geography education. Reviews of GIS curricula find support for teaching critical and open GIS, but reviews of texts and syllabi confirm their marginalization and separation. A new critical open GIS course is introduced, using GIS in development and political ecology as integrative frameworks.},

However, the translation of this evidence into policy processes has proved challenging in some jurisdictions. Approach: This paper presents a critical review of empirical spatial and temporal availability research to identify its features and limitations for informing alcohol availability policies. The UK is used as an example jurisdiction. It reviews 138 studies from a 2008 systematic review of empirical availability research and our update of this to January 2014. Data describing study characteristics (settings, measures, design) were extracted and descriptively analysed. Key Findings: Important limitations in current evidence were identified: (i) outlet-level temporal availability was only measured in three studies, and there has been little innovation in measurement of spatial availability; (ii) empirical analyses focus on acute harms with few studies of longer-term harms; (iii) outlets are typically classified at aggregated levels with little empirical analysis of variation within outlet categories; (iv) evidence comes from a narrow range of countries; and (v) availability away from home, online availability and interactions between availability, price and place are all relatively unexamined. Implications: Greater innovation in study and measure design and enhanced data quality are required. Greater engagement between researchers and policy actors when developing studies would facilitate this. Conclusions: Research and data innovations are needed to address a series of methodological gaps and limitations in the alcohol availability evidence base, advance this research area and enable findings to be translated effectively into policy processes.},

This problem has received much attention in the literature given its practical application, and several solution techniques have been proposed. However, existing approaches are limited in their ability to support real time analysis in big data environments. In this research a multicore computing approach is developed that exploits spatial knowledge through the use of geographic information system functionality to efficiently construct an optimal shortest path. The approach utilizes the notion of a convex hull for iteratively evaluating obstacles and constructing pathways. Further, the approach is capable of incrementally improving bounds, made possible through parallel processing. Wayfinding routes that avoid buildings and other obstacles to travel are derived and discussed.},

  abstract = {Beginning in the 1930s, neighborhood racial composition was an explicit determining factor in the evaluation of U.S. home values. This deliberate practice was outlawed in the 1960s and 1970s, but the correlation between neighborhood racial composition and home values persists. Using Census Bureau data from 1980 to 2015, the present study investigates the changing relationship between neighborhood racial composition and home appraisals, as well as the mechanisms that drive it. Contrary to what is often presumed, neighborhood racial composition was a stronger determinant of appraised values in 2015 than it was in 1980. Results suggest this is primarily due to contemporary appraising practices. Specifically, the use of the sales comparison approach has allowed historical racialized appraisals to influence contemporary values and appraisers' racialized assumptions about neighborhoods to drive appraisal methods. These findings provide strong evidence that persistent racial inequality is driven in part by perpetual devaluing of communities of color and they suggest further regulation is required to foster equity.},

  abstract = {This practical introduction helps readers apply multilevel techniques to their research. Noted as an accessible introduction, the book also includes advanced extensions, making it useful as both an introduction and as a reference to students, researchers, and methodologists. Basic models and examples are discussed in non-technical terms with an emphasis on understanding the methodological and statistical issues involved in using these models. The estimation and interpretation of multilevel models is demonstrated using realistic examples from various disciplines. For example, readers will find data sets on stress in hospitals, GPA scores, survey responses, street safety, epilepsy, divorce, and sociometric scores, to name a few. The data sets are available on the website in SPSS, HLM, MLwiN, LISREL and/or Mplus files. Readers are introduced to both the multilevel regression model and multilevel structural models. Highlights of the second edition include: Two new chapters1em1ptone on multilevel models for ordinal and count data (Ch. 7) and another on multilevel survival analysis (Ch. 8). Thoroughly updated chapters on multilevel structural equation modeling that reflect the enormous technical progress of the last few years. The addition of some simpler examples to help the novice, whilst the more complex examples that combine more than one problem have been retained. A new section on multivariate meta-analysis (Ch. 11). Expanded discussions of covariance structures across time and analyzing longitudinal data where no trend is expected. Expanded chapter on the logistic model for dichotomous data and proportions with new estimation methods. An updated website at http://www.joophox.net/ with data sets for all the text examples and up-to-date screen shots and PowerPoint slides for instructors. Ideal for introductory courses on multilevel modeling and/or ones that introduce this topic in some detail taught in a variety of disciplines including: psychology, education, sociology, the health sciences, and business. The advanced extensions also make this a favorite resource for researchers and methodologists in these disciplines. A basic understanding of ANOVA and multiple regression is assumed. The section on multilevel structural equation models assumes a basic understanding of SEM.},

  abstract = {When formulating a coordinated development strategy for a Multi-Airport System (MAS), it is necessary to consider discrepancies, such as sustainable development level measured by the green efficiency, among member airports. We are particularly interested in whether a so-called ``Matthew effect'' intensifies these discrepancies. A Matthew effect is a social phenomenon often linked to the idea that ``the strong get stronger and the weak weaker''. To this end, we take the MAS in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region (China) as an example and use a super-efficiency data envelopment analysis model based on directional distance function to evaluate the green efficiency of 12 member airports from 2007 to 2019. On that basis, the traditional and spatial transition probability matrices are applied to investigate the Matthew effect with(out) spatial effect, respectively. Our analysis shows that: (1) the green efficiency of YRD MAS has an increasing trend, and the variation of efficiency has a decreased trend; (2) the reverse Matthew effect exists from the standpoint of airport efficiency; (3) a spatial effect has a significant impact on the degree of reverse Mathew effect, and depends on the efficiency types of neighboring airports; and (4) spatial aggregation effect of airports with same efficiency type is not conducive to airport efficiency improvement. We also provide some recommendations to improve airport green efficiency and add to coordinated development for the MAS.},

  abstract = {Homelessness is a global issue that continues to affect the developed and developing world. The absence of comprehensive data collection and measurement of homelessness has led to a general lack of understanding of the global homeless. Improving our knowledge of homelessness requires information that reflects the reality of homelessness and housing exclusion. In this chapter, we review homeless data that is openly available from 14 global cities. With the use of ISO 37120 and open city data, we analysed the extent to which homeless data is standardized, consistent and comparable and the validity of the ISO 37120 indicators in the context of this homeless data. The availability, accessibility and formatting of the open city data are directly compared using ISO 37120 shelter-themed city indicators (ISO 37120. ISO37120: Sustainable development of communities{\textemdash}Indicators for city services and quality of life, 2014) and the City Indicator Data Openness Measure (CIDOM). We found that the majority of the homeless data could be placed into two general categories: homeless profiles and homeless services. There is no standard data model between cities, and periodicity of data collection varied. When directly compared using CIDOM, Toronto came out as the city with the most comprehensive dataset for each of the ISO 37120 shelter indicators. ISO 37120 shelter indicators do provide a standardized means to measure the homeless and unsheltered population of a city, but city Open Data lacks the robustness and utility to produce indicators. Underlying data is not fully published, raising questions of indicator value validity. In the global context, open city homeless data is currently not standardized, consistent or comparable.},

But design philosophies that emphasize exploration over other phases of analysis risk confusing a need for flexibility with a conclusion that exploratory visual analysis is inherently ``model free'' and cannot be formalized. We describe how without a grounding in theories of human statistical inference, research in exploratory visual analysis can lead to contradictory interface objectives and representations of uncertainty that can discourage users from drawing valid inferences. We discuss how the concept of a model check in a Bayesian statistical framework unites exploratory and confirmatory analysis, and how this understanding relates to other proposed theories of graphical inference. Viewing interactive analysis as driven by model checks suggests new directions for software and empirical research around exploratory and visual analysis. For example, systems might enable specifying and explicitly comparing data to null and other reference distributions and better representations of uncertainty. Implications of Bayesian and other theories of graphical inference can be tested against outcomes of interactive analysis by people to drive theory development.},

  abstract = {Background In the 1930's the United States (US) sponsored Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) created maps that determined risk for mortgage lending based on the racial and ethnic composition of neighborhoods leading to disinvestment in ``redlined'' or highest risk neighborhoods. This historical practice has perpetuated racial and economic segregation, and health disparities, that persist today. Interventions near schools where children spend large portions of the day, could impact large groups of children but schools are an often-overlooked environment for exposure. Despite a declining trend of ambient pollution in New York City (NYC) between 1998 and 2012, little is known about differences in air quality improvement near schools by historical redlining neighborhood status. Our objective was to examine if recent temporal trends of air pollution near NYC public schools differed in historically redlined neighborhoods. Methods We examined annual average street-level concentrations of combustion-related air pollutants (black carbon (BC), particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitric oxide (NO)), within a 250-m radius around schools using NYC Community Air Survey land-use regression models (n~=~1,462). Year of monitoring, historical redlining (binary), and summer ozone were included in multivariable linear regression using generalized estimating equation models. Average annual percent change (APC) in pollutant concentration was calculated. Models were further stratified by historical redlining and a multiplicative interaction term (year of monitoring~{\texttimes}~historical redlining) was used to assess effect modification. Results Overall, there was a decreasing trend of BC (APC~=~-4.40\%), PM2.5 (-3.92\%), NO2 (-2.76\%), and NO (-6.20\%) during the 10-year period. A smaller reduction of BC, PM2.5 and NO was observed in redlined neighborhoods (n~=~722), compared to others (n~=~740): BC (APC: -4.11\% vs -4.69\%; Pinteraction~{$<~$}0.01), PM2.5 (-3.82\% vs -4.11\%; Pinteraction~{$<~$}0.01), and NO (-5.73\% vs -6.67\%; Pinteraction~{$<~$}0.01). Temporal trends of NO2 did not differ by historical redlining (Pinteraction~=~0.60). Conclusions Despite significant reductions in annual average pollution concentrations across NYC, schools in historically redlined neighborhoods, compared to others, experienced smaller decrease in pollution, highlighting a potential ongoing ramification of the discriminatory practice.},

Computational tools for data analysis, mapping, visualization, modeling, and simulation are essential for all aspects of the scientific workflow. Specialized scientific software is often developed by geodynamicists for their own use, and this effort represents a distinctive intellectual contribution. Drawing on a geodynamics community that focuses on developing and disseminating scientific software, we assess the current practices of software development and attribution, as well as attitudes about the need and best practices for software citation. We analyzed publications by participants in the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics and conducted mixed method surveys of the solid earth geophysics community. From this we learned that coding skills are typically learned informally. Participants considered good code as trusted, reusable, readable, and not overly complex and considered a good coder as one that participates in the community in an open and reasonable manor contributing to both long- and short-term community projects. Participants strongly supported citing software reflected by the high rate a software package was named in the literature and the high rate of citations in the references. However, lacking are clear instructions from developers on how to cite and education of users on what to cite. In addition, citations did not always lead to discoverability of the resource. A unique identifier to the software package itself, community education, and citation tools would contribute to better attribution practices.},

Market processes and policies that are supposed to spread prosperity and opportunity are no longer sufficiently effective. The evidence points to the existence of several different modes of regional economic performance in Europe, responding to different development challenges and opportunities. Both mainstream and heterodox theories have gaps in their ability to explain the existence of these different regional trajectories and the weakness of the convergence processes among them. Therefore, a different approach is required, one that strengthens Europe's strongest regions but develops new approaches to promote opportunity in industrial declining and less-developed regions. There is ample new theory and evidence to support such an approach, which we have labelled `place-sensitive distributed development policy'.},

Blacks are found to work on that portion of the gradient where wage rates are lowest. Evidence on discrimination suggests that consumer prejudice affects the wages paid to black workers. As distance from the Central Business District (CBD) center increases, the positive wage gradient effect is found to strongly dominate the negative effect on wages from greater consumer discrimination.},

  abstract = {Causal mediation analysis is routinely conducted by applied researchers in a variety of disciplines. The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

To demonstrate the degree or appearance of spatial segregation, most studies on urban residential patterns still rely on fixed spatial units, aspatial measures and single scales. However, a spatial or temporal comparison of patterns and levels of segregation based on such units or metrics is not without problems. To that end, this paper takes an explicit geographic approach and considers individualized neighborhoods using EquiPop-software, allowing various scales. Using the k-nearest neighbors for all individuals increases international comparability and facilitates interpretation, so far often hampered in segregation research. This multiscalar, multigroup comparative approach on ethnic urban geographies {\textendash} using Belgium as a case study {\textendash} provides an empirical illustration of a valuable method and tool applicable in segregation research, thereby furthering the comprehension of the increasingly diverse urban geographies and building on emerging work in the US, Europe and beyond.},

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {Maya and Aztec cities exhibited a distinctive kind of low-density urbanism common in ancient Mesoamerica. The non-monumental components of these cities differed from the high-density ancient and historical cities in the Old World that are often considered the norm for pre-modern urbanism. Distinctive features include the practice of intensive agricultural cultivation within urban settlements, residential zones that were dispersed and unplanned, and the arrangement of houses into spatial clusters that served as urban neighborhoods. The residential areas of Maya and Aztec cities resembled modern peri-urban zones and informal settlements. Because of the benefits of smallholder intensive urban agriculture, cities thrived for many centuries, and some were successful for millennia. On the basis of this longevity, we argue that these were sustainable cities, and their form and dynamics may hold lessons for understanding contemporary urbanization processes.},

In this study, our aim is to explore the association between historic place-based racial discrimination captured in the 1937 Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) map of Philadelphia and present-day violent crime and firearm injuries. The creators of the 1937 HOLC map zoned Philadelphia based in a hierarchical system wherein first-grade and green color zones were used to indicate areas desirable for government-backed mortgage lending and economic development, a second-grade or blue zone for areas that were already developed and stable, a third-grade or yellow zone for areas with evidence of decline and influx of a ``low grade population,'' and fourth-grade or red zone for areas with dilapidated or informal housing and an ``undesirable population'' of predominately Black residents. We conducted an empirical spatial analysis of the concentration of firearm assaults and violent crimes in 2013 through 2014 relative to zoning in the 1937 HOLC map. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors at the time the map was created from the 1940 Census, firearm injury rates are highest in historically red-zoned areas of Philadelphia. The relationship between HOLC map zones and general violent crime is not supported after adjusting for historical Census data. This analysis extends historic perspective to the relationship between emplaced structural racism and violence, and situates the socio-ecological context in which people live at the forefront of this association.},

  abstract = {Compared to residential segregation by race, economic segregation has received relatively little attention in recent empirical literature. Yet a heated debate has arisen concerning Wilson's (1987) hypothesis that increasing economic segregation among African Americans plays a role in the formation of urban ghettos. I present a methodological critique of the measure of economic segregation used by Massey and Eggers (1990) and argue that their measure confounds changes in the income distribution with spatial changes. I develop a "pure" measure of economic segregation based on the correlation ratio and present findings for all U.S. metropolitan areas from 1970 to 1990. Economic segregation increased steadily for Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics in the 1970s and 1980s, but the increases have been particularly large and widespread for Blacks and Hispanics in the 1980s. I explore the causes of these changes in a reduced-form, fixed-effects model. Social distance and structural economic transformations affect economic segregation, but the large increases in economic segregation among minorities in the 1980s cannot be explained by the model. These rapid increases in economic segregation, especially in the context of recent, albeit small, declines in racial segregation, have important implications for urban policy, poverty policy, and the stability of urban communities.},

  abstract = {Objective Controversial and misleading interpretation of data from randomized trials is common. How to avoid misleading interpretation has received little attention. Herein, we describe two applications of an approach that involves blinded interpretation of the results by study investigators. Study Design and Settings The approach involves developing two interpretations of the results on the basis of a blinded review of the primary outcome data (experimental treatment A compared with control treatment B). One interpretation assumes that A is the experimental intervention and another assumes that A is the control. After agreeing that there will be no further changes, the investigators record their decisions and sign the resulting document. The randomization code is then broken, the correct interpretation chosen, and the manuscript finalized. Review of the document by an external authority before finalization can provide another safeguard against interpretation bias. Results We found the blinded preparation of a summary of data interpretation described in this article practical, efficient, and useful. Conclusions Blinded data interpretation may decrease the frequency of misleading data interpretation. Widespread adoption of blinded data interpretation would be greatly facilitated were it added to the minimum set of recommendations outlining proper conduct of randomized controlled trials (eg, the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement).},

  abstract = {Dengue disease has serious health and socioeconomic consequences. Preventive actions are needed to avoid outbreaks. Bayesian spatiotemporal models with conditional autoregressive (CAR) and random walk (RW) priors are two common smoothing approaches used in disease mapping to develop early warning systems and action plans. However, this approach can lead to over-smoothing, such that discontinuities in the risk surface are ?averaged? out. Moreover, local variation in the relationship between disease risk and spatiotemporal risk factors can be concealed by the assumption of homogeneous regression effects. To overcome these problems, we propose a two-stage spatiotemporal clustering approach. In the first stage, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to map out the complete set of cluster configurations. In the second stage, the optimal cluster configuration is selected using a spatiotemporal model with spatiotemporally varying coefficients. The methodology is applied to data for 30 districts in the city of Bandung, Indonesia, for the period January 2012 to December 2016. Weather factors are used as the risk factors. High-risk and low-risk clusters are identified that strongly vary across space and time, with sunshine duration, precipitation, evaporation, and humidity as the most important risk factors.}

The geographic association between hate groups and hate crimes is uncertain. In this research we ask whether hate crimes are co-located and correlated to the presence of hate groups to explore a potential association between these two phenomena. Publicly available point level data on hate crimes and hate groups collected by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) were aggregated to unitary framework of hexagonal grid cells of a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) at multiple scales for consistent analysis. We explore the effects of proximity by interpreting a co-location map, deploying a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) for count data, and apply a Spatial Lag Model (SLM) at multiple scales, to ascertain the effects of the size of the aggregation units on the relationship between hate groups and hate crimes. Controlled or uncontrolled for spatial dependence, at all scales, the Spatial Lag Model (SLM) shows that an average of 39.5\% of the hate crimes was correlated with hate groups. These results are consistent with the existing research but show that in most instances spatial dependence was present, regardless of the size of the aggregation unit or the distance to neighboring cells. Our future research will consider additional racial, economic and social variables using a DGGS.},

A health impact assessment (HIA) identified zoning policy related to alcohol outlets as one way to decrease violent crime. The objectives were to determine the relationship between alcohol outlets including off-premise alcohol outlets and violent crime in one urban area to provide local public health evidence to inform a zoning code rewrite. An ecologic analysis of census tracts in Baltimore City was conducted from 2011 to 2012. The data included violent crimes (n = 51,942) from 2006 to 2010, licensed alcohol outlets establishments (n = 1,327) from 2005 to 2006, and data on neighborhood disadvantage, percent minority, percent occupancy, and drug arrests from 2005 to 2009. Negative binomial regression models were used to determine the relationship between the counts of alcohol outlets and violent crimes controlling for other factors. Spatial correlation was assessed and regression inference adjusted accordingly. Each one-unit increase in the number of alcohol outlets was associated with a 2.2 \% increase in the count of violent crimes adjusting for neighborhood disadvantage, percent minority, percent occupancy, drug arrests, and spatial dependence (IRR = 1.022, 95 \% CI = 1.015, 1.028). Off-premise alcohol outlets were significantly associated with violent crime in the adjusted model (IRR = 1.048, 95 \% CI = 1.035, 1.061). Generating Baltimore-specific estimates of the relationship between alcohol outlets and violent crime has been central to supporting the incorporation of alcohol outlet policies in the zoning code rewrite being conducted in Baltimore City. {\textcopyright} 2013 The New York Academy of Medicine.}

  abstract = {Spatial techniques and fine-scale geographic data may be combined in a variety of innovative ways to serve high-resolution population modeling efforts at local scales, which has been further facilitated by growing computation power and access to open-source spatial data. Previous work has highlighted the importance of a dasymetric approach to produce a parcel-based high-resolution gridded population surface (HGPS). In this study, we investigate the application of land-cover data integrated with the parcel-based HGPS to further improve the accuracy of the HGPS. Consideration is given to twelve combinations made by three land cover strategies (1- no land cover class, 2- five separate classes, and 3three combined classes) and four property type strategies (1- seven types from an empirical study, 2eight residential types, 3- seventeen types within Alachua County, and 4- twenty-five types within Florida). Results from different strategies are statistically compared with the most significant combination identified as three combined land-cover classes (heavy vegetation, 0e50\% and {$>$}50e100\% impervious surface) and with seven property types from the empirical study (single family, mobile family, multi-family (!10 and {$<$}10 units), condominiums, mobile homes parks, and homes for the aged). A final data set named the Enhanced HGPS (E-HGPS) is created for Alachua County, Florida, with a distribution of population counts at the scale of individual housing units. This study highlights an innovative approach to incorporating land-cover and parcel data for the purpose of spatial population modeling, and holds potential to broaden the E-HGPS to a state or regional scope.},

  abstract = {In the context of green and high-quality development, effectively enhancing industrial carbon emission efficiency is critical for reducing carbon emissions and achieving sustainable economic growth. This study explored this research area using three models: the super-efficient SBM model was used to measure the industrial carbon emission efficiency of 48 cities in the Pearl River Basin from 2009 to 2017; the exploratory spatiotemporal data analysis method was used to reveal the spatiotemporal interaction characteristics of industrial carbon emission efficiency; and the geographical detectors and geographically weighted regression model were employed to explore the influencing factors. The results are as follows: (1) The Pearl River Basin's industrial carbon emission efficiency steadily increased from 2009 to 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 0.18 percent, but the industrial carbon emission efficiency of some sites remains low; (2) The local spatiotemporal pattern of industrial carbon emission efficiency is solitary and spatially dependent; (3) The spatial variation of industrial carbon emission efficiency is influenced by a number of factors, including the industrialization level, openness to the outside world, the science and technology level, energy consumption intensity, and productivity level, with the productivity level, industrialization level, and openness to the outside world being the most important. Among these factors, the productivity level, science and technology level, openness to the outside world, and industrialization level all have a positive correlation with industrial carbon emission efficiency, but energy consumption intensity has a negative correlation. This study provides an integrated framework using exploratory spatiotemporal analysis and geographically weighted regression to examine carbon emission efficiency among cities. It can serve as a technical support for carbon reduction policies in cities within the Pearl River Basin, as well as a reference for industrial carbon emission studies of other regions of the world.},

Segregation in schools is often presented as particularly problematic, and as greater than neighbourhood segregation {\textendash} with the implication that a combination of parental choice and Local Education Authority admissions criteria are responsible for that heightened segregation. The validity of such claims is evaluated here for English primary schools using data from the National Pupil Database. Analyses show that for the great majority of schools the proportion of their pupils from South Asian or Black minorities is commensurate with the proportion in their model-defined catchment areas. The main exceptions to this are a relatively small number of Voluntary Aided schools, most with a religious foundation, that can apply faith-based criteria in their admissions policies and tend to draw pupils from wider areas than Community schools lacking that flexibility. A case study of flows in one local authority sustains this general argument {\textendash} that any greater segregation of schools than neighbourhoods in England reflects the different age profiles of White and non-White populations and is not the result of ethnically-biased schools admissions procedures.},

Given the long history of understanding the relationship between neighbourhood context and residential mobility, this study includes measures of satisfaction, safety, decay and neighbourly agency to understand mobility. Using data from the Making Connections Initiative, this paper uses a unique panel survey across neighbourhoods in 10 US cities undergoing spatial and/or demographic transitions to analyse the extent to which neighbourhood perceptions are associated with residential mobility. By employing a multilevel structural equation model, the study accounts for neighbourhood perceptions, neighbourhood demographics and mobility risk over time. The results show that perceptions of neighbourhood context matter more than the actual neighbourhood setting. These findings highlight the continued importance of subjective rather than objective measures of neighbourhood conditions in understanding residential mobility.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern and spatial diffusion of elderly suicide by age cohort, in Korea. Study design The research investigated the elderly suicide rates of the 232 municipal units in South Korea between 2001 and 2011. Methods The Gi* score, which is a spatially weighted indicator of area attributes, was used to identify hot spots and the spatiotemporal pattern of elderly suicide in the nation during the last 10 years. The spatial Markov matrix and spatial dynamic panel data model were employed to identify and estimate the diffusion effect. Results The suicide rate among elderly individuals 75 years and older was substantially higher than the rate for those between 65 and 74 years of age; however, the spatial patterns of the suicide clusters were similar between the two groups. From 2001 to 2011, the spatial distribution of elderly suicide hot spots differed each year. For both age cohorts, elderly suicide hot spots developed around the north area of South Korea in 2001 and moved to the mid-east area and the mid-western coastal area over 10 years. The spatial Markov matrix indicates that the change in the suicide rate of one area was affected by the suicide rates of neighbouring areas from the previous year, which suggests that suicide increase in one area inflates a neighbouring area's suicide rate over time. Using a spatial dynamic panel data model, elderly suicide diffusion effects were found to be statistically significant for both age cohorts even after economic and demographic indicators and a time variable are included. For individuals 75 years and older, the diffusion effect appeared to be larger. Conclusions This study demonstrates that elderly suicide can spread spatially over time in both age cohorts. Thus, it is necessary to design a place-based and age-differentiated intervention policy that precisely considers the spatial diffusion of elderly suicide.},

  abstract = {Standard models of labor migration suggest that migration is induced by real income differentials across locations and will, ceteris paribus, serve to reduce those differentials. And yet there is evidence that growing spatial inequality may co-exist with increased migration from poorer to richer areas, at least over certain ranges. At a theoretical level, this raises the question of modeling opposing forces, for convergence and divergence, in a common framework, and identifying the precise conditions under which the tendency for convergence dominates, or is dominated by, the forces for divergence. A conventional route to introducing forces for divergence is to bring agglomeration effects into the standard setup. This paper explores an alternative route, based on a theoretical and empirical proposition of the migration literature, namely, that migration is a selective process. Focusing on skilled migration, the paper demonstrates the different forces in play that make selective migration a force for both divergence and convergence, and characterizes where each set of forces dominates. Finally, it explores the consequences for convergence of combining migration selectivity and agglomeration effects arising from migrant networks.},

Most extant work on employment centres focuses on identification methodology or their dynamics during a period of industrial restructuring from 1980 to 2000. We analyse employment centres using point-based, rather than census tract-based employment data and a non-parametric identification method with a single concept of proximity. We focus on changes across five key industries: knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS), retail, creative, industrial and high-tech, emphasising changes in centre composition as well as their boundaries. Results show far greater change across centres than previous longitudinal studies. Only 43\% of the land area that is in an employment centre is part of one in both 1997 and 2014. Using a persistence score, centres range from stable to highly fluctuating, but emerging, persisting and dying centres are found in core and fringe areas alike. KIBS are most associated with stable centres, while high tech employment is attracted toward emerging areas and retail exists throughout. Emerging centres are more likely to have greater accessibility, while industrial employment becomes far more concentrated in centres by 2014.},

  abstract = {Spatial effects have been recognized to play an important role in transitional dynamics of regional incomes. Detection and evaluation of both spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence in discrete Markov chain models, which have been widely applied to the study of regional income distribution dynamics and convergence, are vital, but under-explored issues. Indeed, in this spatiotemporal setting, spatial effects can take much more complex forms than that in a pure cross-sectional setting. In this paper, we address two test frameworks. The first is a conditional spatial Markov chains test framework, which can be used to detect spatial heterogeneity and temporally lagged spatial dependence; the second is a joint spatial Markov chains test framework, which tests for contemporaneous spatial dependence. A series of Monte Carlo experiments are designed to examine size, power and robustness properties of these tests for a range of sample sizes (spatial \$\${\textbackslash}times \$\$temporal dimensions), for different levels of discretization granularity and for different number of regimes. Results indicate that all tests display good size property except when sample size is fairly small. All tests for spatial dependence are similar in almost all aspects{\textemdash}size, power and robustness. Conditional spatial Markov tests for spatial heterogeneity have highest power for detecting spatial heterogeneity. Granularity of discretization has a major impact on the size properties of the tests when sample size is fairly small.},

  abstract = {Income mobility measures provide convenient and concise ways to reveal the dynamic nature of regional income distributions. Statistical inference about these measures is important especially when it comes to a comparison of two regional income systems. Although the analytical sampling distributions of relevant estimators and test statistics have been asymptotically derived, their properties in small sample settings and in the presence of contemporaneous spatial dependence within a regional income system are underexplored. We approach these issues via a series of Monte Carlo experiments that require the proposal of a novel data generating process capable of generating spatially dependent time series given a transition probability matrix and a specified level of spatial dependence. Results suggest that when sample size is small, the mobility estimator is biased while spatial dependence inflates its asymptotic variance, raising the Type I error rate for a one-sample test. For the two-sample test of the difference in mobility between two regional economic systems, the size tends to become increasingly upward biased with stronger spatial dependence in either income system, which indicates that conclusions about differences in mobility between two different regional systems need to be drawn with caution as the presence of spatial dependence can lead to false positives. In light of this, we suggest adjustments for the critical values of relevant test statistics.},

  abstract = {In this paper we move away from a static view of neighbourhood inequality and investigate the dynamics of neighbourhood economic status, which ties together spatial income inequality at different moments in time. Using census data from three decades (1980{\textendash}2010) in 294 metropolitan statistical areas, we use a statistical decomposition method to unpack the aggregate spatiotemporal income dynamic into its contributing components: stability, growth and polarisation, providing a new look at the economic fortunes of diverse neighbourhoods. We examine the relative strength of each component in driving the overall pattern, in addition to whether, how, and why these forces wax and wane across space and over time. Our results show that over the long run, growth is a dominant form of change across all metros, but there is a very clear decline in its prominence over time. Further, we find a growing positive relationship between the components of dispersion and growth, in a reversal of prior trends. Looking across metro areas, we find temporal heterogeneity has been driven by different socioeconomic factors over time (such as sectoral growth in certain decades), and that these relationships vary enormously with geography and time. Together these findings suggest a high level of temporal heterogeneity in neighbourhood income dynamics, a phenomenon which remains largely unexplored in the current literature. There is no universal law governing the changing economic status of neighbourhoods in the US over the last 40 years, and our work demonstrates the importance of considering shifting dynamics over multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

Two discrete kernel estimators with cross-validated parameters are proposed for reducing the sparsity in the estimated transition probability matrix. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that these estimators are not only quite effective in producing a much less sparse matrix, alleviating issues related to sparsity, but also superior to MLEs in terms of lowering the mean squared error for individual and total transition probability, giving rise to the better recovery of the underlying dynamics.},

The central hypothesis is that, having a rich (poor) spatial proximity increases the chances to move towards higher (lower) income classes. Our preliminary evidence covers the 1975{\textendash}2017 period and points out that Turkish regions are not converging on average rather converging to varying income levels. This signals the formation of convergence clubs. Our augmented analyses highlight that the club convergence process is influenced from the income level of neighbor regions. Those regions whose neighbors belong to high income classes have higher chances to move to higher income classes, whereas the peripheral regions linked with the poor ones are getting more isolated. Our results highlight that regional policy framework and local economic activity has an influence beyond the administrative boundaries of regions. This calls for spatially flexible and smart local policies to combat with regional disparities.},

The two main features of our approach are the construction of a combination tree and the definition of an operator {$\otimes$}t applied to the nodes of the tree that allow us to generate without duplication the connected subgraphs. We describe and analyze ConSubg(k, G), then demonstrate its effectiveness on random graphs with a fixed degree, scalefree networks, and dual graphs of constraint satisfaction problems.},

In this study, we conduct an analysis of more than 10,000 U.S. census tracts experiencing population loss in order to better understand the variegated nature of population decline in the United States. Using high-dimensional cluster analysis, we classify tracts into seven distinct groups, and then assess group differences based on population characteristics and built environment indicators. Our findings show inter- and intraregional characteristics that are far from uniform. Our results imply that public policy responses cannot be developed as a one-size-fits-all strategy, nor should the outlook of urban shrinkage be understood as a nationally uniform crisis. Future work can build upon our typological definitions to offer additional insights valuable to local decision makers and leaders regarding the complex relationship between demographic change and associated socio-economic outcomes.},

In the study of geographic phenomena, a distinct form of replicability is particularly important {\textendash} whether a result obtained in one geographic context applies in another geographic context. However, the laws of geography suggest that it may be challenging to use replication to assess the credibility of findings across space and to identify new laws. Many geographic phenomena are spatially heterogeneous, which implies they exhibit uncontrolled variance across the surface of the earth and lack a characteristic mean. When a phenomenon is spatially heterogeneous, it may be difficult or impossible to establish baselines or rules for study-to-study comparisons. At the same time, geographic observations are typically spatially dependent, which makes it difficult to isolate the effects of interest for cross-study comparison. In this paper, we discuss how laws describing the spatial variation of phenomena may influence the use of replication in geographic research. Developing a set of shared principles for replication assessment based on fundamental laws of geography is a prerequisite for adapting replication standards to meet the needs of disciplinary subfields while maintaining a shared analytical foundation for convergent spatial research.},

  abstract = {A common causal identification strategy in political science is selection on observables. This strategy assumes one observes a set of covariates that is, after statistical adjustment, sufficient to make treatment status as-if random. Under adjustment methods such as matching or inverse probability weighting, coefficients for control variables are treated as nuisance parameters and are not directly estimated. This is in direct contrast to regression approaches where estimated parameters are obtained for all covariates. Analysts often find it tempting to give a causal interpretation to all the parameters in such regression models{\textemdash}indeed, such interpretations are often central to the proposed research design. In this paper, we ask when we can justify interpreting two or more coefficients in a regression model as causal parameters. We demonstrate that analysts must appeal to causal identification assumptions to give estimates causal interpretations. Under selection on observables, this task is complicated by the fact that more than one causal effect might be identified. We show how causal graphs provide a framework for clearly delineating which effects are presumed to be identified and thus merit a causal interpretation, and which are not. We conclude with a set of recommendations for how researchers should interpret estimates from regression models when causal inference is the goal.},

It articulates the principles and current practice of modern spatial econometrics and spatial statistics, combining rigorous depth of presentation with unusual depth of coverage.  Introducing and formalizing the principles of, and `need' for, models which define spatial interactions, the book provides a comprehensive framework for almost every major facet of modern science. Subjects covered at length include spatial regression models, weighting matrices, estimation procedures and the complications associated with their use. The work particularly focuses on models of uncertainty and estimation under various complications relating to model specifications, data problems, tests of hypotheses, along with systems and panel data extensions which are covered in exhaustive detail.  Extensions discussing pre-test procedures and Bayesian methodologies are provided at length. Throughout, direct applications of spatial models are described in detail, with copious illustrative empirical examples demonstrating how readers might implement spatial analysis in research projects.  Designed as a textbook and reference companion, every chapter concludes with a set of questions for formal or self--study. Finally, the book includes extensive supplementing information in a large sample theory in the R programming language that supports early career econometricians interested in the implementation of statistical procedures covered.},

A particularity in software markets is that an individual's purchasing decision is often influenced by other users' choices. Although such customer network effects are evident, their quantitative assessment remain elusive with conventional approaches. This book contributes to closing this gap by developing methods for measuring network effects and their implications for valuation in software markets. Based on the theory of complex networks the book reveals that such diffusion processes highly depend on structural properties of customer networks. Moreover, it depicts that such insights are contributions to improve the quality of valuations in software markets. But the implications of this research also comprise social and political aspects as they can be applied in order to prevent corporate failures in all network effect markets.},

To separate the partisan effects of redistricting from the effects of other factors including geography and redistricting rules, we compare possible party compositions of the US House under the enacted plan to those under a set of alternative simulated plans that serve as a nonpartisan baseline. We find that partisan gerrymandering is widespread in the 2020 redistricting cycle, but most of the electoral bias it creates cancels at the national level, giving Republicans two additional seats on average. Geography and redistricting rules separately contribute a moderate pro-Republican bias. Finally, we find that partisan gerrymandering reduces electoral competition and makes the partisan composition of the US House less responsive to shifts in the national vote.},

We develop five distinct spatial interaction models (SIMs) of increasing complexity, each encompassing a lower and upper level model.

At the upper level, spatial interactions among zones are modeled taking into account competing origins, competing destinations as well as network characteristics.

  abstract = {Selecting a learning algorithm to implement for a particular application on the basis of performance still remains an ad-hoc process using fundamental benchmarks such as evaluating a classifier's overall loss function and misclassification metrics. In this paper we address the difficulty of model selection by evaluating the overall classification performance between random forest and logistic regression for datasets comprised of various underlying structures: (1) increasing the variance in the explanatory and noise variables, (2) increasing the number of noise variables, (3) increasing the number of explanatory variables, (4) increasing the number of observations. We developed a model evaluation tool capable of simulating classifier models for these dataset characteristics and performance metrics such as true positive rate, false positive rate, and accuracy under specific conditions. We found that when increasing the variance in the explanatory and noise variables, logistic regression consistently performed with a higher overall accuracy as compared to random forest. However, the true positive rate for random forest was higher than logistic regression and yielded a higher false positive rate for dataset with increasing noise variables. Each case study consisted of 1000 simulations and the model performances consistently showed the false positive rate for random forest with 100 trees to be statistically different than logistic regression. In all four cases, logistic regression and random forest achieved varying relative classification scores under various simulated dataset conditions.},

Randomization tests are proposed for two situations: (a) one set is considered fixed and the other random and (b) both sets of points are considered random. For each situation an empirical randomization test and its normal approximation are given. In either case a variety of space and time distance measures may be used. The adequacy of the normal approximation for a contrived example was determined empirically using two favored measures, the 0, 1 indicator function, and the reciprocal of distance (time) plus a constant. As examples for actual data, the reciprocal measure is used to test for space-time clustering between a set of dog and a set of cat lymphoma cases, and the indicator measure is used for underground nuclear tests and earthquakes.},

  abstract = {"Blending behavioral science and design, Leidy Klotz's Subtract: The Untapped Science of Less offers a scientific appreciation of why we underuse subtraction-and how to access its untapped potential. When humans solve problems, we overlook an incredibly powerful option: We don't subtract. We pile on "to-dos" but don't consider "stop-doings." We create incentives for high performance, but don't get rid of obstacles to our goals. Whether considering a stack of Legos, preparing a grilled cheese sandwich, or writing an essay, Leidy Klotz shows that we consistently overlook the principle of subtraction as a way to improve. Our mental preference for addition-for adding to what's already there rather than thinking of taking away-is so wide-spread and strong that we would prefer to accommodate wrong ideas than simply remove them. Drawing from his own pioneering research and scientific research throughout history, Klotz examines cultural, political, and economic trends underlying our neglect of subtraction, asserting that we have billions of years of evidence showing that lifeforms are perfectly capable of subtracting to improve. Proposing a new way to frame our behaviors, Klotz shares thought-provoking examples and anecdotes to supplement his proven techniques on implementing a new perspective and understanding of subtraction. By learning to use the counterintuitive approach of subtracting, we can revolutionize not just our day-to-day lives, but our work across every field and industry. Subtract shows how this innovative approach to life is the key to unlocking our greatest potential"--},

  abstract = {As evidence of the contextual effects of place upon individual outcomes has become increasingly solid over time, so too have urban policies and programs designed to connect underserved people with access to spatial opportunity. To this end, many attempts have been made to quantify the geography of opportunity and quite literally plot it on a map by combining evidence from studies on neighborhood effects with spatial data resources and geographic information systems (GIS) technology. Recently, these opportunity maps have not only become increasingly common but their preparation has been encouraged and facilitated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. A closer look at the foundations and methods that underlie these exercises offers important lessons I examine the practice of opportunity mapping from both theoretical and methodological perspectives, highlighting several weaknesses of the common methods. Following this, I outline a theoretical framework based on Galster's categorization of the mechanisms of neighborhood effects. Using data from the Baltimore metropolitan region, I use confirmatory factor analysis to specify a measurement model that verifies the validity of the proposed theoretical framework. The model provides estimates of four latent variables conceived as the essential dimensions of spatial opportunity: socialinteractive, environmental, geographic, and institutional. Finally, I develop a neighborhood typology using unsupervised machine learning applied to the four dimensions of opportunity. Results suggest that opportunity mapping can be improved substantially through a better connection to the empirical literature on neighborhood effects, a multivariate statistical framework, and more direct relevance to public policy interventions.},

Classically, segregation indices are calculated based on areal groupings (e.g., counties or census tracts), with more recent research exploring ways that spatial relationships can enter the equation. Spatial segregation measures embody the notion that proximity to one's neighbors is a better specification of residential segregation than simply who resides together inside the same arbitrarily drawn polygon. Thus, they expand the notion of ``who is nearby'' to include those who are geographically close to each polygon rather than a binary inside/outside distinction. Yet spatial segregation indices often resort to crude measurements of proximity, such as the Euclidean distance between observations, given the complexity and data requirements of calculating more theoretically appropriate measures, such as distance along the pedestrian travel network. In this paper, we examine the ramifications of such decisions. For each metropolitan region in the U.S., we compute both Euclidean and network-based spatial segregation indices. We use a novel inferential framework to examine the statistical significance of the difference between the two measures and following, we use features of the network topology (e.g., connectivity, circuity, throughput) to explain this difference using a series of regression models. We show that there is often a large difference between segregation indices when measured by these two strategies (which is frequently significant).

Using annual block-level data from the Longitudinal Employment Household Dynamics database, we introduce a novel technique for identifying regional employment centers that adheres to both urban economic theory and pays homage to classic contributions in local spatial statistics. Our identification process recognizes that theories of agglomeration economies are founded on the basis of accessibility to jobs, not simply their concentration into arbitrary boundaries. Centers are then defined as local spatial statistical outliers on the network-based cumulative accessibility surface. We proceed by identifying the location and employment makeup of centers for each metropolitan region in the USA from 2002 to 2019 and discuss emergent trends across time and space.

Since definitions of the neighbourhood and research designs vary greatly across studies, it is difficult to ascertain which neighbourhoods and outcomes matter the most. By conducting parallel analyses of the impact of neighbourhood deprivation on life satisfaction and earnings at multiple scales, we provide a direct empirical test of which scale matters the most and whether the effects vary between outcomes. Our identification strategy combines rich longitudinal information on individual characteristics, family background and initial job conditions for England and Wales with econometric estimators that address residential sorting bias, and we compare results for individuals living in choice-restricted social housing with results for those living in self-selected privately rented housing. We find that the effect of neighbourhood deprivation on life satisfaction and wages is negative for both outcomes and largely explained by strong residential sorting on both individual and neighbourhood characteristics rather than a genuine causal effect. We also find that the results overall do not vary by neighbourhood scale.},

We introduce four different types of prior distributions for space{\texttimes}time interaction in extension of a model with only main effects. Each type implies a certain degree of prior dependence for the interaction parameters, and corresponds to the product of one of the two spatial with one of the two temporal main effects. The methodology is illustrated by an analysis of Ohio lung cancer data 1968{\textendash}1988 via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. We compare the fit and the complexity of several models with different types of interaction by means of quantities related to the posterior deviance. Our results confirm an epidemiological hypothesis about the temporal development of the association between urbanization and risk factors for cancer.

  abstract = {The study evaluates food access dynamics by implementing advanced spatial analytics that better account for the complex patterns of food access, and quasi-experimental research design to distill the impact of the Great Recession on the foodscape. It utilizes a validated series of supermarket data in the City of Chicago for 2007, 2011, and 2014. As different processes may drive different trends, isolating unique patterns is essential to testing assumptions that are hypothesized to change the foodscape. An innovative mix of exploratory methods investigates spatial and temporal aspects of supermarket access by building a validated, longitudinal dataset; generating a highresolution potential food access score for each cross-section; and identifying trends, outliers and significant clusters in both spatial and temporal dimensions. To quantify the effect of the Recession, a sensitivity analysis of quasi-experimental models using different spatial conceptualizations was implemented to explore both consistency and variations in treatment. Chicago neighborhoods with more foreclosure experienced a small but significant worsening in food accessibility after the Great Recession. This is the case even after accounting for variations in income, group effects, and patterns of racial segregation. Persistent trends of inequity across the entire time period study remain, with significantly worse access in segregated black neighborhoods. Inference interpretation is sensitive to both research design framing and underlying processes that drive geographically distributed relationships. For highly spatial phenomenon like segregation and foreclosure, making space explicit may reduce the magnification of certain results.},

Accurate geospatial predictions are vital for domain research based on ecosystem monitoring and quality assessment and for policy-making and action planning, considering effective management of natural resources. The accuracy and computation speed of ML has generally proved efficient. However, many questions have yet to be addressed to obtain precise and reproducible results suitable for further use in both research and practice. A better understanding of the ML concepts applicable to geospatial problems enhances the development of data science tools providing transparent information crucial for making decisions on global challenges such as biosphere degradation and climate change. This survey reviews common nuances in geospatial modelling, such as imbalanced data, spatial autocorrelation, prediction errors, model generalisation, domain specificity, and uncertainty estimation. We provide an overview of techniques and popular programming tools to overcome or account for the challenges. We also discuss prospects for geospatial Artificial Intelligence in environmental applications.},

Krause is a pioneer in the revolutionary new science of archaeogenetics, archaeology augmented by revolutionary DNA sequencing technology, which has allowed scientists to uncover a new version of human history reaching back more than 100,000 years. Using this technology to re-examine human bones from the distant past, Krause has been able to map not only the genetic profiles of the dead, but also their ancient journeys. In this concise narrative he tells us their long-forgotten stories of migration and intersection. It's well known that many human populations carry genetic material from Neanderthals; but, as Krause and his colleagues discovered, we also share DNA with a newly uncovered human form, the Denisovans. We know now that a wave of farmers from Anatolia migrated into Europe 8,000 years ago, essentially displacing the dark-skinned, blue-eyed hunter-gatherers who preceded them. The farmer DNA is one of the core genetic components of contemporary Europeans and European Americans. Though the first people to cross into North and South America have long been assumed to be primarily of East Asian descent, we now know that they also share DNA with contemporary Europeans and European Americans. Genetics has an unfortunate history of smuggling in racist ideologies, but our most cutting-edge science tells us that genetic categories in no way reflect national borders. Krause vividly introduces us to prehistoric cultures such as the Aurignacians, innovative artisans who carved animals, people, and even flutes from bird bones more than 40,000 years ago; the Varna, who buried their loved ones with gold long before the Pharaohs of Egypt; and the Gravettians, big-game hunters who were Europe's most successful early settlers until they perished in the ice age. This informed retelling of the human epic confirms that immigration and genetic mingling have always defined our species and that who we are is a question of culture not genetics"--},

Furthermore, the suggested multidimensional procedure facilitates the analysis of the implications of different urban spatial structures in terms of physical urban form. All analyses are conducted on the spatial scale of 1 km{$^2$} grid cells to allow for spatially detailed results and to account for intra-municipality differences in the urban spatial structures in the study regions. The results indicate fundamental differences among the study regions' distribution of employees and built-up volumes and, as a result, among their urban spatial structures. Both employees and built-up volumes are found to be highly spatially clustered primarily within the core cities but with notable exceptions, which thus qualifies the regions as polycentric. This finding is consistent with prior research but also reveals that built-up volumes can be understood as physical manifestations of proximity advantages to which firms and employees are subject.},

These geographic units, born out of concerns for urban well-being, were first proposed in 1906 to provide a ``convenient and scientific city map system''for the City of New York. They were employed for the first time in the U.S. census in 1910 in eight cities, via a joint effort involving the U.S. Census Bureau and state and local health departments. Initially termed ``sanitary areas''because of their relevance to planning for public health and health services, census tracts are now widely used by all sectors of government and by myriad disciplines in the health, social, and geographic sciences for research as well as policy development, implementation, and evaluation. In this article, I describe the census tract's underappreciated origins, give examples of its current use in analyzing and addressing social disparities in health and health care, and discuss its continued significance and implications for population health and the public data required for informed democratic governance.},

We used the recently digitized HOLC redlining maps for 28 municipalities in Massachusetts to analyze Massachusetts Cancer Registry data for late stage at diagnosis for cervical, breast, lung, and colorectal cancer (2001{\textendash}2015). Multivariable analyses indicated that, net of age, sex/gender, and race/ethnicity, residing in a previously HOLC-redlined area imposed an elevated risk for late stage at diagnosis, even for residents of census tracts with present-day economic and racial privilege, whereas the best historical HOLC grade was not protective for residents of census tracts without such current privilege. For example, a substantially elevated risk of late stage at diagnosis occurred among men with lung cancer residing in currently privileged areas that had been redlined (risk~ratio =~1.17, 95\% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.29), whereas such risk was attenuated among men residing in census tracts lacking such current privilege (risk ratio =~1.01, 95\% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.08). Research on historical redlining as a structural driver of health inequities is warranted.},

  abstract = {The Poisson gravity model along with pseudo maximum likelihood (ML) methods has become a popular way to model international trade flows. This approach has several econometric advantages that we outline in the paper. We argue that estimating the parameters by ML would only be justified statistically if the trade flows were independent. Such an assumption, however, is generally not valid, and a failure to account for spatial dependence may lead to biased parameter estimates and misleading inferences. To overcome this estimation problem we suggest eigenvector spatial filtering variants of the Poisson gravity model (without and with zero-inflation) along with pseudo ML estimation.},

Our approach focuses on spatial weights which are binary prior to row-standardization. However, unlike recent literature our approach requires no strong a priori assumptions on (socio-)economic distances between the spatial units. The estimation approach relies on efficient Gibbs sampling techniques and can be easily combined with and extended to more flexible spatial specifications. In addition to geographic prior structures, we also discuss shrinkage priors on the neighbourhood size, which are particularly useful in spatial panels where T is small relative to N.},

Our approach relies on recent advances in Bayesian computing, making use of P{\'o}lya-Gamma sampling for Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The proposed specification assumes that the involved log-odds of the model follow a spatial autoregressive process. P{\'o}lya-Gamma sampling involves a computationally efficient treatment of the spatial autoregressive logit model, allowing for extensions to the existing baseline specification in an elegant and straightforward way. In a Monte Carlo study we demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing spatial autoregressive probit specifications both in terms of parameter precision and computational time. The paper moreover illustrates the performance of the proposed spatial autoregressive logit specification using pan-European regional data on foreign direct investments. Our empirical results highlight the importance of accounting for spatial dependence when modelling European regional FDI flows.},

There is no better guide than Paul Krugman to basic economics, the ideas that animate much of our public policy. Likewise, there is no better foe of zombie economics, the misunderstandings that just won't die. This delightful new book finds Krugman at his best, turning readers into intelligent consumers of the daily news with quick, vivid sketches of the key concepts behind taxes, health care, international trade, and more. Arguing with Zombies will put Krugman at the front of the debate in the 2020 election year. Building on and expanding his New York Times columns and other writings, it contains short, accessible chapters on topics including the fight for national health care in the United States, the housing bubble and financial meltdown of 2007- 2008, the European Union and Brexit, the attack on Social Security, and the fraudulent argument- the ultimate zombie- that tax cuts for the rich will benefit all"--},

However, the reason for this tendency is not apparent. This paper suggests that the correlation between segregation and metropolitan scale is spurious. Segregation measures based on census data will tend to rank larger cities higher because larger cities have more neighbourhoods that are big enough to `fill up' entire census tracts, while smaller cities with equally homogeneous, but smaller, neighbourhoods have to pair neighbourhoods to fill up a census tract. This bias will be reduced at smaller levels of spatial aggregation. This prediction is tested by comparing segregation measures computed at several levels of spatial aggregation and with American Housing Survey data. The results suggest that spatial aggregation effects are important: the correlation between city size and measured segregation appears to be at least partly spurious.},

We then use these data sets to compare the power of the spatial scan statistic, the maximized excess events test and the nonparametric M statistic. All have good power, the first having an advantage for localized hot-spot type clusters and the second for global clustering where randomly located cases generate other cases close by. By making the simulated data sets publicly available, new tests can easily be compared with previously evaluated tests by analyzing the same benchmark data.},

Moreover, apart from these individual characteristics, we demonstrate that the socioeconomic composition of neighbourhoods and schools is important for understanding differences in school advice. The analysis shows that neighbourhood and school socioeconomic disadvantage negatively affects the school advice of children with highly educated parents, while socioeconomic advantage positively affects all children and especially children of lower- and intermediate-educated parents. The positive neighbourhood effects are, however, mediated by primary school context. We suggest that while most of the educational inequalities may be explained by individual characteristics, residential and school segregation intensify these inequalities, especially through the beneficial effects of neighbourhood and school advantage.},

  abstract = {The spatial prediction of point values from areal data of the same attribute is addressed within the general geostatistical framework of change of support; the term support refers to the domain informed by each datum or unknown value. It is demonstrated that the proposed geostatistical framework can explicitly and consistently account for the support differences between the available areal data and the sought-after point predictions. In particular, it is proved that appropriate modeling of all area-to-area and area-to-point covariances required by the geostatistical frame-work yields coherent (mass-preserving or pycnophylactic) predictions. In other words, the areal average (or areal total) of point predictions within any arbitrary area informed by an areal-average (or areal-total) datum is equal to that particular datum. In addition, the proposed geostatistical framework offers the unique advantage of providing a measure of the reliability (standard error) of each point prediction. It is also demonstrated that several existing approaches for area-to-point interpolation can be viewed within this geostatistical framework. More precisely, it is shown that (i) the choropleth map case corresponds to the geostatistical solution under the assumption of spatial independence at the point support level; (ii) several forms of kernel smoothing can be regarded as alternative (albeit sometimes incoherent) implementations of the geostatistical approach; and (iii) Tobler's smooth pycnophylactic interpolation, on a quasi-infinite domain without non-negativity constraints, corresponds to the geostatistical solution when the semivariogram model adopted at the point support level is identified to the free-space Green's functions (linear in 1-D or logarithmic in 2-D) of Poisson's partial differential equation. In lieu of a formal case study, several 1-D examples are given to illustrate pertinent concepts.},

The relative precision of own-price elasticities increased in most cases, suggesting gains in efficiency when the covariance estimator of transition probabilities is adjusted for temporal and spatial dependence and cross-equation correlation. In this example, adjusting for temporal-spatial dependence moderates the absolute magnitude of elasticity point estimates.

Despite numerous recent developments in intelligent areal interpolation methods, and studies that have demonstrated their clear advantage over simple areal weighting, there is little evidence to suggest widespread usage amongst the GIS user community. It is argued that to encourage greater uptake such methods must offer simplicity and convenience. Areal interpolation based on binary dasymetric mapping is conceptually simple, but examples to date tend to use information extracted from multi-spectral satellite imagery which limits its perceived convenience. This paper examines a simple method to extract equivalent information from a raster pixel map. It is shown to offer comparable areal interpolation performance at considerably less cost in terms of both time and complexity.},

Using this information, the course instructor selected relevant geography resources and applications using workforce data obtained from a sample of geographers employed in private and public sectors. Over the semester, students encountered those applications through class presentations, videos, and individual advising sessions. At the end, students completed a post-test survey. Resulting datasets offered the instructor a means to reflect upon and select geographic content that is accessible and applicable to what students aspire to be and do in the future. Analysis of the pre- and post-test survey data indicate positive gains in student attitudes but suggest additional culturally relevant pedagogical enhancements are needed to account for student diversity and context. The article concludes with a critical assessment of how future instructors might leverage aspirations and workforce data to address the underrepresentation of women and minorities in the discipline and workforce.},

  abstract = {Models of the geographic distributions of species have wide application in ecology. But the nonspatial, single-level, regression models that ecologists have often employed do not deal with problems of irregular sampling intensity or spatial dependence, and do not adequately quantify uncertainty. We show here how to build statistical models that can handle these features of spatial prediction and provide richer, more powerful inference about species niche relations, distributions, and the effects of human disturbance. We begin with a familiar generalized linear model and build in additional features, including spatial random effects and hierarchical levels. Since these models are fully specified statistical models, we show that it is possible to add complexity without sacrificing interpretability. This step-by-step approach, together with attached code that implements a simple, spatially explicit, regression model, is structured to facilitate self-teaching. All models are developed in a Bayesian framework. We assess the performance of the models by using them to predict the distributions of two plant species (Proteaceae) from South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We demonstrate that making distribution models spatially explicit can be essential for accurately characterizing the environmental response of species, predicting their probability of occurrence, and assessing uncertainty in the model results. Adding hierarchical levels to the models has further advantages in allowing human transformation of the landscape to be taken into account, as well as additional features of the sampling process.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an urban land-use simulation model using cellular automata (CA). In the model urban growth is regarded as the result of a global process underpinned by local actions and land-use change as the joint action of three different effects: attribute, heterogeneity, and gravity. The attribute and heterogeneity effects are regarded as different aspects of a local driving force for change constituted by changing accessibility and other attributes resulting from the interaction of land use and transport at the neighborhood level. The gravity effect is a universal resistance to change as a result of inertia and agglomeration of compatible land uses in the vicinity. To ensure that local actions would lead to global behavior, a multipass, in addition to a single-pass, land-use-allocation algorithm is designed to mimic land-use changes. With metropolitan Melbourne in Australia as a case study, the performance of the model in replicating land-use changes is compared with that of an alternative model developed by using only a distance function. The results of the comparison show that the proposed CA model outperforms the alternative model with only a distance function, confirming the importance of incorporating local attributes in modeling land-use changes.},

The notational framework is rich enough to encompass a variety of existing procedures, including some recently discussed methods involving stochastic search or hierarchical clustering, but more importantly allows the formulation of clustering procedures that are optimal with respect to a specified loss function. Our focus is on loss functions based on pairwise coincidences, that is, whether pairs of items are clustered into the same subset or not.Optimization of the posterior expected loss function can be formulated as a binary integer programming problem, which can be readily solved by standard software when clustering a modest number of items, but quickly becomes impractical as problem scale increases. To combat this, a new heuristic item-swapping algorithm is introduced. This performs well in our numerical experiments, on both simulated and real data examples. The article includes a comparison of the statistical performance of the (approximate) optimal clustering with earlier methods that are model-based but ad hoc in their detailed definition.},

  abstract = {In this paper we examine whether the physical availability of alcohol is greater in predominantly African American communities compared to predominantly white communities as indicated by the presence of off premises liquor stores. We investigate the extent to which the income status of the residents of a community mediates the relationship between community racial composition and alcohol availability; and explore whether the intersection of race and class places low income African American communities at increased risk to have such stores located in their communities. Multivariate analytic techniques are used to examine the relationship between community racial composition, median income of neighborhood residents and per capita number of alcohol outlets in 194 census tracts in Baltimore, Maryland. The analysis found that liquor stores are disproportionately located in predominantly black census tracts, even after controlling for census tract socioeconomic status. Census tracts that are both low income and predominantly African American have substantially more liquor stores per capita than other census tracts. Although it is beyond the scope of the present study, our data reveal significant associations between the presence of liquor stores and the risk of health-related social problems in low income neighborhoods. More research needs to be done on the impact of alcohol on the social, psychological, and physiological health of low income urban populations. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {The spatial patterning of crime hotspots provides place-based information for the design, allocation, and implementation of crime prevention policies and programmes. However, most spatial hotspot identification methods are univariate, analyse a single crime type, and do not consider if hotspots are shared amongst multiple crime types. This study applies a Bayesian spatial shared component model to identify crime-general and crime-specific hotspots for violent crime and property crime at the small-area scale. The spatial shared component model jointly analyzes both violent crime and property crime and separates the area-specific risks of each crime type into one shared component, which captures the underlying crime-general spatial pattern common to both crime types, and one type-specific component, which captures the crime-specific spatial pattern that diverges from the shared pattern. Crime-general and crime-specific hotspots are classified based on the posterior probability estimates of the shared and type-specific components, respectively. Results show that the crime-general pattern explains approximately 81\% of the total variation of violent crime and 70\% of the total variation of property crime. Crime-general hotspots are found to be more frequent than crime-specific hotspots, and property crime-specific hotspots are more frequent than violent crimespecific hotspots. Crime-general and crime-specific hotspots are areas that may be targeted with comprehensive initiatives designed for multiple crime types or specialized initiatives designed for a single crime type, respectively.},

  abstract = {Traditional studies of school differences in educational achievement use multilevel modelling techniques to take into account the nesting of pupils within schools. However, educational data are known to have more complex non-hierarchical structures. The potential importance of such structures is apparent when considering the effect of pupil mobility during secondary schooling on educational achievement. Movements of pupils between schools suggest that we should model pupils as belonging to the series of schools that are attended and not just their final school. Since these school moves are strongly linked to residential moves, it is important to explore additionally whether achievement is also affected by the history of neighbourhoods that are lived in. Using the national pupil database, this paper combines multiple membership and cross-classified multilevel models to explore simultaneously the relationships between secondary school, primary school, neighbourhood and educational achievement. The results show a negative relationship between pupil mobility and achievement, the strength of which depends greatly on the nature and timing of these moves. Accounting for pupil mobility also reveals that schools and neighbourhoods are more important than shown by previous analysis. A strong primary school effect appears to last long after a child has left that phase of schooling.The additional effect of neighbourhoods, in contrast, is small. Crucially, the rank order of school effects across all types of pupil is sensitive to whether we account for the complexity of the multilevel data structure.},

This study devises an L statistic by integrating Pearson's r as an aspatial bivariate association measure and Moran's I as a univariate spatial association measure.

We perform various tests to examine the Markov property embedded in a frequency domain by checking for the presence of the Markov property in the various chromatin states. We apply these tests to each region of the fifteen chromatin states. The results of our simulation indicate that some of the chromatin states possess a stronger Markov property than others.

  abstract = {Introduction Greater availability of commercial alcohol is associated with increased alcohol use and related public health problems. Greater alcohol outlet density, a marker of alcohol availability, is associated with poorer and predominantly minority neighborhoods. However, poorer populations, African Americans, and Latinxs report using less alcohol compared to Whites and wealthier groups. We consider the role of structural racism in the social ecology of alcohol availability. Specifically we examine racist urban land use practices in the USA which became codified in the 1930s through Federal Home Owner Lending Corporation (HOLC) designations for assigning parcel values, known as ``redlining.'' Redlining demarcated low-density residential zones for wealthy Whites which excluded poor and non-White people as well as certain businesses, including alcohol retailers. We assessed the impacts of historic redlining on present day risks for exposure to retail alcohol availability in urban Northern California. Methods For six contiguous and demographically diverse Northern California cities we obtained digital renderings of HOLC maps (1937) which demarcated exclusions of people and businesses for 119 neighborhood areas across four land valuation zones. We then identified the most prevalent HOLC rating for each of 520 current Census block groups in the six cities, including a residual category for areas not rated by HOLC. We geolocated all current (2016) off-premise alcohol sales outlets operating in the six cities (N~=~401). We used Bayesian spatial Poisson models to relate current alcohol outlet densities and Census-based estimates of neighborhood characteristics to historic HOLC classifications. Results Spatial Poisson analyses found far greater contemporary off-premise outlet densities in the lowest-valued HOLC zones than in the highest (median relative rate [RR] 9.6, 95\% CI 4.8{\textendash}22.1). The lowest-valued HOLC zones were also characterized by far higher current percentages of both Black residents (RR 30.4, 95\% CI 17.0{\textendash}54.6) and Hispanic residents (RR 9.7, 95\% CI 7.2{\textendash}12.9). Conclusions Present day risks for exposure to retail alcohol availability were delimited by historic exclusionary land use practices. Current inequitable health risks may be founded on racist spatial projects of past decades.},

Yet, few studies examine the particular challenges and spatial processes that occur at the bordering region between two neighborhoods. Extending the growing literature on spatial interdependence, this article argues that neighborhood boundaries{\textemdash}defined as sharp changes in the racial or socioeconomic composition of neighborhoods{\textemdash}are a salient feature of the spatial structure with implications for violent crime and other outcomes. Boundaries lack the social control and cohesion of adjacent homogeneous areas, are contested between groups provoking intergroup conflict, and create opportunities for criminal behavior. This article presents evidence linking racial neighborhood boundaries to increased violent crime. The findings illustrate the importance of neighborhood boundaries for our understanding of spatial dimensions of population dynamics above and beyond the characteristics of neighborhoods.},

Filling this void, Introduction to Spatial Econometrics presents a variety of regression methods used to analyze spatial data samples that violate the traditional assumption of independence between observations. It explores a wide range of alternative topics, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation, various types of spatial regression specifications, and applied modeling situations involving different circumstances.  Leaders in this field, the authors clarify the often-mystifying phenomenon of simultaneous spatial dependence. By presenting new methods, they help with the interpretation of spatial regression models, especially ones that include spatial lags of the dependent variable. The authors also examine the relationship between spatiotemporal processes and long-run equilibrium states that are characterized by simultaneous spatial dependence. MATLAB{\textregistered} toolboxes useful for spatial econometric estimation are available on the authors' websites.  This work covers spatial econometric modeling as well as numerous applied illustrations of the methods. It encompasses many recent advances in spatial econometric models\rule{1em}{1pt}including some previously unpublished results.},

We first empirically study the relationship between luminosity data and regional incomes for those countries where regional income data are available. We subsequently use our estimation results for an out-ofsample prediction of regional incomes based on the luminosity data, which allows us to investigate regional income differentials in developing countries as well, where official income data are lacking. Based on the predicted incomes, we calculate commonly used measures of regional inequality within countries. Investigating changes in the dispersion of regional incomes over time reveals that approximately 71-80\% of all countries face sigma-convergence. Finally, we study different major determinants of the level of regional inequality based on cross-section data. Panel regressions investigate the within-country changes in inequality, i.e., the determinants of the convergence process. We find evidence for an N-shaped relationship between development and regional inequality. Geography, mobility and trade openness are also highly important.},

In this paper, we study the characteristics of error structures in intersections and polygon overlays. When locations of the endpoints of two line segments are in error, we analyze errors of the intersection point and obtain its error covariance matrix through the propagation of the error covariance matrices of the endpoints. An approximate law of error propagation for the intersection point is formulated within the MBGIS framework. From simulation experiments, it appears that both the relative positioning of two line segments and the error characteristics of the endpoints can affect the error characteristics of the intersection. Nevertheless, the approximate law of error propagation captures nicely the error characteristics under various situations. Based on the derived results, error analysis in polygon-on-polygon overlay operation is also performed. The relationship between the error covariance matrices of the original polygons and the overlaid polygons is approximately established.},

  abstract = {There are always problems in spatial data, which makes spatial data cleaning the most important preparation for data mining. If spatial data are input without cleaning, the subsequent discovery may be unreliable and thus produce inaccurate output knowledge as well as erroneous decision-making results. This chapter discusses the problems that occur in spatial datasets and the various data cleaning techniques to remediate these problems. Spatial observation errors mainly include stochastic errors, systematic errors, and gross errors, such as incompleteness, inaccuracy, repetitiveness, inconsistency, and deformation in spatial datasets from multiple sources with heterogeneous characteristics. Classical stochastic error models are further categorized as indirect adjustment, condition adjustment, indirect adjustment with conditions, condition adjustment with parameters, and condition adjustment with conditions. All of these models are considered parameters as non-random variables in a generalized error model. By selecting weight for iteration, Li Deren made the assumption of two multi-dimensional alternates of Gauss-Markov when he established the distinction and reliability theory of adjustment. As a result, Li extended Baarda theory into multiple dimensions and realized the unification of robust estimation and least squares.},

Focusing on two types of network capabilities, namely acquisition capability and control capability, the paper uses spatial regime models to compare the impacts of multiple factors on different spatial regimes. The main conclusions are the following. First, as regards SKN, the political-administrative hierarchy has shaped the spatial evolution of acquisition capacity, forming a pattern consisting of three dominant cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing), three subsidiary cities (Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Wuhan), and multiple lesser centers (Tianjin, Chengdu, Xi'an). Moreover, high control capability cities are mainly clustered in the coastal areas, specifically, one monocentric city (Beijing) and two polycentric metropolises (Shanghai, Wuhan). Second, for TKN, cities with high acquisition and control also are mainly found in coastal areas, with Shanghai and Beijing dominating network capabilities. The model's analysis confirms the positive effect of network capabilities on innovation development, especially in scientific knowledge networks, and the driver for regional innovation development appears to have shifted from global pipeline (globalization) to local buzz (localized talents). This paper concludes with suggestions regarding network capabilities' potential to reduce regional inequality and achieve sustainable development of regional economies.},

  abstract = {The financial crisis has dramatically reshaped the map of inequality; in particular, wealth has been redistributed because of fluctuations in the prices of equities and housing. However, since the explanation of this issue has by default been seen as economists' responsibility, the spatial dimension of the financial crisis still remains unexplored, especially at the intra-urban level. This study examines the local geographies of the housing value bust (2008{\textendash}2012) and boom (2012{\textendash}2016) since the financial crisis, with an explicit emphasis on their impacts on urban inequality in Salt Lake County, Utah. We find that housing value changes differ across space and appear strongly associated with the spatial distribution of neighborhood conditions and urban amenities. Additional regressions confirm that a city's housing market volatility is amplified by uneven distribution of physical and service amenities and residential segregation. Moreover, the significance level of local attributes changes over the bust-boom cycle of the housing market. The comparison between bust and boom models suggests that the value of houses enjoying shade from trees and proximity to jobs, places of worship, and good public schools are more resilient, experiencing less value drop in an economic bust, but also less increase in a boom. Other amenities such as public transport, hospitals, parks, and restaurants could be interpreted as types of discretionary consumption, which positively contribute to housing value volatility. Neighborhood conditions, especially white-Hispanic segregation, significantly contribute to housing value fluctuation. Hispanic communities in Salt Lake County tend to experience more loss of property value in a bust and gain more in a boom. Thus, our study suggests that a more balanced urban distribution of employment, races, and amenities would significantly enhance local economic stability by smoothing fluctuations of business cycles at the local level.},

Drawing on popular concepts such as scale, network and place-frames found in the literature on contentious politics, we argue that the place-making practices observed during the period of study became claim-making practices that effectively framed movement aims and projected movement claims beyond the neighbourhood scale into a dynamic contestation at the city and national scales. Adopting key elements of neighbourhood as defined by Jenks and Dempsey, we highlight that the socio-spatial practices of the Anti-ELAB protests not only re-cast city spaces into neighbourhood spaces but also redefined traditional understandings of neighbourhood as a socio-spatial construct. We argue that during the Anti-ELAB movement an `ideological neighbourhood' emerged in which spatial relationality is not borne out through physical proximity. Instead, connections between functional and social units were established through ideological affinity. These new connections and the replication of neighbourhood-based practices reinforced the construction of a socially and politically distinct Hong Kong identity. We extend the literatures on contentious politics and urban sociology by showing that the ideology and the imaginaries of movement participants can become spatially manifest and thus defensible in the physical world through new territorialities such as the neighbourhood.},

  abstract = {Background Opioid overdose events and deaths have become a serious public health crisis in the United States, and understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of the disease occurrences is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies, informing health systems policy and planning, and guiding local responses. However, current research lacks the capability to observe the dynamics of the opioid crisis at a fine spatial-temporal resolution over a long period, leading to ineffective policies and interventions at the local level. Methods This paper proposes a novel regionalized sequential alignment analysis using opioid overdose events data to assess the spatiotemporal similarity of opioid overdose evolutionary trajectories within regions that share similar socioeconomic status. The model synthesizes the shape and correlation of space-time trajectories to assist space-time pattern mining in different neighborhoods, identifying trajectories that exhibit similar spatiotemporal characteristics for further analysis. Results By adopting this methodology, we can better understand the spatiotemporal evolution of opioid overdose events and identify regions with similar patterns of evolution. This enables policymakers and health researchers to develop effective interventions and policies to address the opioid crisis at the local level. Conclusions The proposed methodology provides a new framework for understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of opioid overdose events, enabling policymakers and health researchers to develop effective interventions and policies to address this growing public health crisis.},

Yet their emphasis on systematic favoritism for whites over blacks tells only part of the story. This article examines how a broader, waning concept of race that encompassed nationality as well as skin color influenced the practice of locational risk rating at the Federal Housing Administration. Using qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the construction of ``neighborhood risk'' reveals how, from the introduction of the agency's underwriting standards, raters depended on a more nuanced population classification scheme in evaluating urban areas. The evidence presented here about the differential treatment of nationality groups points to new directions for studies of housing policy in the United States.},

This paper presents and describes a new polycategorical method that integrates positive aspects of both geographically weighted regression (GWR)-based and quantile regression (QR)based interpolators for solving areal interpolation problems. Two different types of neighborhoods for selecting observations used to estimate ancillary control densities are presented: one that is spatially based and one that is statistically based. The new polycategorical methods are evaluated against a number of existing methods {\textendash} areal weighting, pycnophylactic, binary dasymetric, intelligent dasymetric mapping, and GWR using test data from the 2010 census population, the National Land Cover Database 2006 (NLCD2006) and the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Reference (TIGER) line graph files. The evaluations include several overall error measurement indices as well as maps of the spatial distribution of the error associated with selected methods. Results suggest that with appropriate land cover categories and neighborhoods, the new polycategorical methods provide comparable results to local regression models but with much less computation complexity.},

This ecologic study assessed the spatial and temporal distribution of drug activity in Baltimore, Maryland, prior to and following the implementation of a large urban redevelopment project in East Baltimore, which began in 2003. Drug activity was measured by narcotic calls for service at the neighborhood level. A space-time scan statistic approach was used to identify statistically significant clusters of narcotic calls for service across space and time, using a discrete Poisson model. After adjusting for economic deprivation and housing vacancy, clusters of narcotic calls for service were identified among neighborhoods located in Southeast, Northeast, Northwest, and West Baltimore from 2001 to 2010. Clusters of narcotic calls for service were identified among neighborhoods located in East Baltimore from 2001 to 2003, indicating a decrease in narcotic calls thereafter. A large proportion of clusters occurred among neighborhoods located in North and Northeast Baltimore after 2003, which indicated a potential spike during this time frame. These findings suggest potential displacement of drug activity coinciding with the initiation of urban redevelopment in East Baltimore. Space-time scan statistics should be used in future research to describe the potential implications of local policies on drug activity.},

We find that compared with the 1990s, the expansive trend of inter-provincial disparities has slowed down and started to decrease somewhat since 2000. In 2004 and 2005, some statistical indicators, such as per capita GDP and per capita household consumption at current prices, show that regional disparities have declined to a certain extent. In addition to the great disparity among provinces, disparities within provinces are also very common in the PRC. Judged by some measurement indexes, income disparities within many provinces have even exceeded inter-provincial disparities.},

Although it is possible to account for several different types of weak spatial lag dependence by several different weights matrices, the W-based approach usually proceeds on the basis of a single weights matrix that is implicitly assumed to adequately capture all types of spatial dependence. SEM on the other hand has been developed to explicitly distinguish between different types of weak spatial dependence in a model. In addition, whereas conventional higher order spatial econometric models entail specification and parameter space definition problems, SEM spatial dependence models can be routinely specified and estimated. In this paper we briefly discuss the pitfalls of including several types of weak spatial lag dependence (and thus different W matrices) in a standard W-based lag model and how these problems are mitigated by the SEM approach. Furthermore, the single W-based and the SEM approach are compared by means of simulations in terms of bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) for different values of the spatial lag parameters, specifications of the weights matrices, and sample sizes. We also include in the comparison the W-based approach with spatial dependence accounted for by the two weights matrices used to generate the data: that is, the correctly specified model. The simulation results show that compared with the single W-based models, SEM frequently has smaller bias and RMSE. Furthermore, SEM even outperforms the correctly specified W-based models (based on the same two weights matrices used for data generation) in many cases. These trends increase when the values of the spatial lag parameters increase. The dominance of SEM also increases with sample size. Finally, SEM is more stable in terms of both bias and RMSE over various dimensions.},

The results show that the coordination of urbanization and eco-environment are in a state of basic coordination. The coupling coordination degree of each province is gradually increasing and the spatial difference gradually narrows as time evolves. A spatial dependence is observed in the coordination of provincial urbanization and eco-environment in China from the perspective of global correlation and its dependence is weakened with the increase of geographical distance. The local agglomeration mode presents a trend towards the evolution of the ``high-high'' clustering mode. Finally, the spatial Markov chain method is used to forecast the provincial coordination degree in 2016. It is further confirmed that the coordinated state of urbanization and eco-environment is getting better and the spatial correlation is strengthening in the future.},

This paper introduces environmental justice theories in industrial location studies. A heu\- ristic analytical framework is proposed to analyze the distribution and determinants of polluting enterprises in Guangdong, China, a highly developed region but with high social and economic inequality. Polluting enterprises are mostly agglomerated in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region with the rest in the mountainous and hilly nonPRD region. Bivariate local spatial autocorrelation analysis shows the colocation of polluting enterprises and migrants. Our regression results reveal that the county where many migrant residents are concentrated histor\- ically appears to attract many polluting firms to enter. However, less firms are found in the county with many highly educated groups and ethnic minorities. Land space planning, environmental regulation, labor costs, and agglomeration economy have driven the distribution of new polluting enterprises, whereas the influences of traffic accessibility and border effect do not work actually. To some extent, the distribution of new polluting enterprises must be recognized as a predictable result of the characteristics of prior demographic distribution.},

  abstract = {With the rapid urbanization and industrialization, the uneven distribution of polluting enterprises among different socioeconomic groups has become a prominent environmental social problem in transitional China but is rarely recognized. This paper introduces environmental justice theories in industrial location studies. A heu\- ristic analytical framework is proposed to analyze the distribution and determinants of polluting enterprises in Guangdong, China, a highly developed region but with high social and economic inequality. Polluting enterprises are mostly agglomerated in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region with the rest in the mountainous and hilly nonPRD region. Bivariate local spatial autocorrelation analysis shows the colocation of polluting enterprises and migrants. Our regression results reveal that the county where many migrant residents are concentrated histor\- ically appears to attract many polluting firms to enter. However, less firms are found in the county with many highly educated groups and ethnic minorities. Land space planning, environmental regulation, labor costs, and agglomeration economy have driven the distribution of new polluting enterprises, whereas the influences of traffic accessibility and border effect do not work actually. To some extent, the distribution of new polluting enterprises must be recognized as a predictable result of the characteristics of prior demographic distribution.},

  abstract = {The Segregation Index quantifies the degree of segregation of social groups or classes. Because of the increasing use of fine-grained spatiotemporal activity and flow data, the conventional segregation measurements' inclusiveness is challenged. We add population flow to the conventional place-based spatial exposure index to identify spatiotemporal segregation changes. Specifically, we considered the population-flow network, hierarchical structure, and time. In Chicago's demonstration case study, we first used the time-dependent Twitter Origin-Destination flow matrices and their hierarchical structure information to estimate interactions between areal units at the neighborhood level. Then we computed the new population composition of units based on their interactions with other units and estimated the proposed spatiotemporal exposure index for different times. Finally, we systematically compared their differences with the conventional indices at global and local scales to see how population-flow patterns affect the exposure index. The results show that the population-flow patterns reflect valuable information in neighborhood interactions in temporal and spatial dimensions, but it is missing information in the conventional segregation computations. Furthermore, we emphasize that the hierarchical structures of flow patterns and the choice of appropriate parameters are also important factors for a rational segregation evaluation.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a generalized spatial regionalization problem, namely, PRUC (               P               -Regions with User-defined Constraint) that partitions spatial areas into homogeneous regions. PRUC accounts for user-defined constraints imposed over aggregate region properties. We show that PRUC is an NP-Hard problem. To solve PRUC, we introduce GSLO (Global Search with Local Optimization), a parallel stochastic regionalization algorithm. GSLO is composed of two phases: (1)               Global Search               that initially partitions areas into regions that satisfy a user-defined constraint, and (2)               Local Optimization               that further improves the quality of the partitioning with respect to intra-region similarity. We conduct an extensive experimental study using real datasets to evaluate the performance of GSLO. Experimental results show that GSLO is up to 100{\texttimes} faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms. GSLO provides partitioning that is up to 6{\texttimes} better with respect to intra-region similarity. Furthermore, GSLO is able to handle 4{\texttimes} larger datasets than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract = {China currently has the largest total CO2 emissions and is one of the countries that has made the most efforts to cut these. Anthropogenic emissions from county-level districts play a pivotal role in meeting carbon neutral due to the favorable breakdown of reduction targets into sub-national units, whereas limited work has been done related to those features and determinants. Here, we attempted to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of county carbon emissions and their drivers in China between 2000 and 2020 using an exploratory space-time data analysis (ESTDA) and spatial econometric method based on a remote sensing image inversion dataset. The results showed that emissions per capita and per unit of GDP in Chinese counties took on drastically opposite stances amid a trend of increasing carbon emissions. Meanwhile, their carbon emissions exhibited a pronounced regional disparity and spatially positive autocorrelation, characterized by sharp spatial heterogeneity and clustering. Local indicators of spatial association implied that the patterns of county carbon emissions had certain spatial integration, and that locally correlated forms were represented by deep path dependence and spatial locking effects. Besides, a range of panel regression models provided evidence of endogenous interactions of county carbon emissions, notably where every 1\% increase in the neighboring emissions induced a local emissions increase by at least 0.4\%. Various factors employed not only exerted a direct impact on local carbon emissions, but had spatial spillover effects on neighboring districts. Of these, economic level and industrial structure presented a significantly positive relationship with carbon emissions, while population clustering, financial input and technological advance had clear inhibitory effects. Our findings cast fresh light on the importance of the socioeconomic diversity of a district and its neighbors for government policy decisions related to carbon abatement at the county level.},

  abstract = {Aims: A large number of studies have found links between alcohol outlet densities and assault rates in local areas. This study tests a variety of specifications of this link, focusing in particular on the possibility of a non-linear relationship. Design: Cross-sectional data on police-recorded assaults during high alcohol hours, liquor outlets and socio-demographic characteristics were obtained for 223 postcodes in Melbourne, Australia. These data were used to construct a series of models testing the nature of the relationship between alcohol outlet density and assault, while controlling for socio-demographic factors and spatial auto-correlation. Four types of relationship were examined: a normal linear relationship between outlet density and assault, a non-linear relationship with potential threshold or saturation densities, a relationship mediated by the socio-economic status of the neighbourhood and a relationship which takes into account the effect of outlets in surrounding neighbourhoods. Findings: The model positing non-linear relationships between outlet density and assaults was found to fit the data most effectively. An increasing accelerating effect for the density of hotel (pub) licences was found, suggesting a plausible upper limit for these licences in Melbourne postcodes. Conclusions: The study finds positive relationships between outlet density and assault rates and provides evidence that this relationship is non-linear and thus has critical values at which licensing policy-makers can impose density limits. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author.}

First, the application areas where Kronecker products abound are all thriving. These include signal processing, image processing, semidefinite programming, and quantum computing. Second, sparse factorizations and Kronecker products are proving to be a very effective way to look at fast linear transforms. Researchers have taken the Kronecker methodology as developed for the fast Fourier transform and used it to build exciting alternatives. Third, as computers get more powerful, researchers are more willing to entertain problems of high dimension and this leads to Kronecker products whenever low-dimension techniques are ``tensored'' together.},

  abstract = {Social scientists regularly rely on population estimates when studying change in small areas over time. Census tract data in the United States are a prime example, as there are substantial shifts in tract boundaries from decade to decade. This study compares alternative estimates of the 2000 population living within 2010 tract boundaries to the Census Bureau's own retabulation. All methods of estimation are subject to error; this is the first study to directly quantify the error in alternative interpolation methods for U.S. census tracts. A simple areal weighting method closely approximates the estimates provided by one standard source (the Neighborhood Change Data Base), with some improvement provided by considering only area not covered by water. More information is used by the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), which relies on a combination of areal and population interpolation as well as ancillary data about water-covered areas. Another set of estimates provided by the National Historical Geographic Information Systems (NHGIS) uses data about land cover in 2001 and the current road network and distribution of population and housing units at the block level. Areal weighting alone results in a large error in a substantial share of tracts that were divided in complex ways. The LTDB and NHGIS perform much better in all situations but are subject to some error when boundaries of both tracts and their component blocks are redrawn. Users of harmonized tract data should be watchful for potential problems in either of these data sources. (English)},

  abstract = {Geographic analysis has long supported transport plans that are appropriate to local contexts. Many incumbent `tools of the trade' are proprietary and were developed to support growth in motor traffic, limiting their utility for transport planners who have been tasked with twenty-first century objectives such as enabling citizen participation, reducing pollution, and increasing levels of physical activity by getting more people walking and cycling. Geographic techniques{\textemdash}such as route analysis, network editing, localised impact assessment and interactive map visualisation{\textemdash}have great potential to support modern transport planning priorities. The aim of this paper is to explore emerging open source tools for geographic analysis in transport planning, with reference to the literature and a review of open source tools that are already being used. A key finding is that a growing number of options exist, challenging the current landscape of proprietary tools. These can be classified as command-line interface, graphical user interface or web-based user interface tools and by the framework in which they were implemented, with numerous tools released as R, Python and JavaScript packages, and QGIS plugins. The review found a diverse and rapidly evolving `ecosystem' tools, with 25 tools that were designed for geographic analysis to support transport planning outlined in terms of their popularity and functionality based on online documentation. They ranged in size from single-purpose tools such as the QGIS plugin AwaP to sophisticated stand-alone multi-modal traffic simulation software such as MATSim, SUMO and Veins. Building on their ability to re-use the most effective components from other open source projects, developers of open source transport planning tools can avoid `reinventing the wheel' and focus on innovation, the `gamified' A/B Street https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/\#abstreetsimulation software, based on OpenStreetMap, a case in point. The paper, the source code of which can be found at https://github.com/robinlovelace/open-gat, concludes that, although many of the tools reviewed are still evolving and further research is needed to understand their relative strengths and barriers to uptake, open source tools for geographic analysis in transport planning already hold great potential to help generate the strategic visions of change and evidence that is needed by transport planners in the twenty-first century.},

Its longstanding dependence on visualization and cartography shows as much, with John Snow's cholera map serving as one of the first instances of geovisual analytics in science (Arribas-Bel, de Graaff, \& Rey, 2017; Johnson, 2007), and the perennial presence of maps as statistical displays in seminal works on visualization (Tufte, 2001). As such, the existence and continued focus on maps in geographical analysis demands serious, dedicated attention in scientific computing. However, existing methods in Python, specifically for statistical visualization of spatial data, are lacking. General-purpose mapping provided by geopandas is not fine-tuned enough for statistical analysis (Jordahl et al., 2019). The more analytically-oriented views offered by geoplot, while useful, are limited in their statistical applications (Bilogur, Karve, Marsano, \& Fleischmann, 2019). Thus, the need remains for a strong, analytically-oriented toolbox for visual geographical analysis.},

The essential point here is to take into account dynamically evolving input graphs: having a cluster graph (that is, a disjoint union of cliques) constituting a solution for a first input graph, can we cost-efficiently transform it into a ``similar'' cluster graph that is a solution for a second (``subsequent'') input graph? This model is motivated by several application scenarios, including incremental clustering, the search for compromise clusterings, or also local search in graph-based data clustering. We thoroughly study six problem variants (three modification scenarios edge editing, edge deletion, edge insertion; each combined with two distance measures between cluster graphs). We obtain both fixed-parameter tractability as well as (parameterized) hardness results, thus (except for three open questions) providing a fairly complete picture of the parameterized computational complexity landscape under the two perhaps most natural parameterizations: the distances of the new ``similar'' cluster graph to (1)~the second input graph and to (2)~the input cluster graph.},

Consequently, Jeffreys's tests are of considerable theoretical and practical relevance for empirical researchers in general and for experimental psychologists in particular. To highlight this relevance and to facilitate the interpretation and use of Jeffreys's Bayes factor tests we focus on two common inferential scenarios: testing the nullity of a normal mean (i.e.,~the Bayesian equivalent of the t-test) and testing the nullity of a correlation. For both Bayes factor tests, we explain their development, we extend them to one-sided problems, and we apply them to concrete examples from experimental psychology.},

We conducted an ecologic study to 1) examine historic redlining in relation to current neighborhood lending discrimination and three key indicators of societal health (mental health, physical health, and infant mortality rate (IMR)) and 2) investigate sustained lending disinvestment as a determinant of current neighborhood health in one of the most hypersegregated metropolitan areas in the United States, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We calculated weighted historic redlining scores from the proportion of 1930s Home Owners' Loan Corporation residential security grades contained within 2010 census tract boundaries. We combined two lending indicators from 2018 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data to capture current neighborhood lending discrimination: low lending occurrence and high cost loans (measured via loan rate spread). Using historic redlining score and current lending discrimination, we created a 4-level hierarchical measure of lending trajectory. In Milwaukee neighborhoods, greater historic redlining was associated with current lending discrimination (OR~=~1.73, 95\%CI: 1.16, 2.58) and increased prevalence of poor physical health ({$\beta~$}=~1.34, 95\%CI: 0.40, 2.28) and poor mental health ({$\beta~$}=~1.26, 95\%CI: 0.51, 2.01). Historic redlining was not associated with neighborhood IMR ({$\beta~$}=~-0.48, 95\%CI: -2.12, 1.15). A graded association was observed between lending trajectory and health: neighborhoods with high sustained disinvestment had worse physical and mental health than neighborhoods with high investment (poor physical health: {$\beta~$}=~5.33, 95\%CI: 3.05, 7.61; poor mental health: {$\beta~$}=~4.32, 95\%CI: 2.44, 6.20). IMR was highest in `disinvested' neighborhoods ({$\beta~$}=~5.87, 95\%CI: 0.52, 11.22). Our findings illustrate ongoing legacies of government sponsored historic redlining. Structural racism, as manifested in historic and current forms of lending disinvestment, predicts poor health in Milwaukee's hypersegregated neighborhoods. We endorse equity focused policies that dismantle and repair the ways racism is entrenched in America's social fabric.},

While the neighbourhood has long been recognized as an important unit of analysis, there is surprisingly little systematic research on different neighbourhood types, especially in the fastgrowing cities of the Global South. In this paper we employ k-means clustering, a common machinelearning algorithm, to develop a neighbourhood typology for South Africa's eight largest cities. Using census data, we identify and describe eight neighbourhood types, each with distinct demographic, socio-economic, structural and infrastructural characteristics. This is followed by a relational comparison of the neighbourhood types along key variables, where we demonstrate the persistent and multidimensional nature of residential inequalities. In addition to shedding new light on the internal structure of South African cities, the paper makes an important contribution by applying an inductive, data-driven approach to developing neighbourhood typologies that advances a more sophisticated and nuanced understanding of cities in the Global South.},

It plays a crucial role in providing forage and maintaining the ecological security of Northern China. China has initiated many ecological restoration projects in the agro-pastoral ecotone. Separating the affecting factors of anthropogenic activities and natural factors change on grassland may help guide future ecological restoration projects. This study investigated the grassland change over the agro-pastoral ecotone in Inner Mongolia (APEI) using land use data, vegetation index, and monthly climate data, social and economic data from 2010 to 2020. Two indicators were introduced to evaluate the grassland change in quality and quantity. The average annual maximum NDVI of grassland within each sample was used as a proxy for grassland quality, and the proportion of grassland within each sample was used as a proxy for grassland quantity. The driving mechanisms of grassland quality were examined on different types of grassland. The results showed that (1) from 2010 to 2020, the quantity of grassland in APEI slightly decreased while the quality of the grassland significantly improved; (2) the change in grassland quality was jointly caused by natural factors and human activities, with 66.77\% being attributed to natural factors and 33.23\% to human activities. In some areas, the alteration in grassland quality was solely determined by either the impacts of natural factors or human-induced disturbances; and (3) temperature and precipitation played different roles in affecting grassland quality among different types of grassland. In some areas, anthropogenic activities, such as farmland and population, would affect grassland quality. The findings of this study would contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of ecological environmental changes in the agro-pastoral ecotone and guide the planning and implementation of future ecological restoration projects in agro-pastoral areas.},

  abstract = {An important step in developing individualized treatment strategies is correct identification of subgroups of a heterogeneous population to allow specific treatment for each subgroup. This article considers the problem using samples drawn from a population consisting of subgroups with different mean values, along with certain covariates. We propose a penalized approach for subgroup analysis based on a regression model, in which heterogeneity is driven by unobserved latent factors and thus can be represented by using subjectspecific intercepts. We apply concave penalty functions to pairwise differences of the intercepts. This procedure automatically divides the observations into subgroups. To implement the proposed approach, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm with concave penalties and demonstrate its convergence. We also establish the theoretical properties of our proposed estimator and determine the order requirement of the minimal difference of signals between groups to recover them. These results provide a sound basis for making statistical inference in subgroup analysis. Our proposed method is further illustrated by simulation studies and analysis of a Cleveland heart disease dataset. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the estimation of a large dimensional factor model when the factor loadings exhibit an unknown number of changes over time. We propose a novel three-step procedure to detect the breaks if any and then identify their locations. In the first step, we divide the whole time span into subintervals and fit a conventional factor model on each interval. In the second step, we apply the adaptive fused group Lasso to identify intervals containing a break. In the third step, we devise a grid search method to estimate the location of the break on each identified interval. We show that with probability approaching one our method can identify the correct number of changes and estimate the break locations. Simulation studies indicate superb finite sample performance of our method. We apply our method to investigate Stock and Watson's (2009) U.S. monthly macroeconomic data set and identify five breaks in the factor loadings, spanning 1959-2006.},

  abstract = {Current visual analytics systems provide users with the means to explore trends in their data. Linked views and interactive displays provide insight into correlations among people, events, and places in space and time. Analysts search for events of interest through statistical tools linked to visual displays, drill down into the data, and form hypotheses based upon the available information. However, current systems stop short of predicting events. In spatiotemporal data, analysts are searching for regions of space and time with unusually high incidences of events (hotspots). In the cases where hotspots are found, analysts would like to predict how these regions may grow in order to plan resource allocation and preventative measures. Furthermore, analysts would also like to predict where future hotspots may occur. To facilitate such forecasting, we have created a predictive visual analytics toolkit that provides analysts with linked spatiotemporal and statistical analytic views. Our system models spatiotemporal events through the combination of kernel density estimation for event distribution and seasonal trend decomposition by loess smoothing for temporal predictions. We provide analysts with estimates of error in our modeling, along with spatial and temporal alerts to indicate the occurrence of statistically significant hotspots. Spatial data are distributed based on a modeling of previous event locations, thereby maintaining a temporal coherence with past events. Such tools allow analysts to perform real-time hypothesis testing, plan intervention strategies, and allocate resources to correspond to perceived threats.},

  abstract = {Common to all tests of space{\textendash}time interaction is the assumption that the population underlying the events of interest exhibits a trajectory of growth that is consistent through time and across space. In practice, however, this assumption is often untenable and, when violated, can introduce population shift bias into the results of these tests. While this problem is widely recognized, more work remains to compare its effect across tests and to determine the extent to which it is a problem for study short periods. This paper quantifies and compares the population shift bias present in the results of the Knox, Mantel, and Jacquez tests of space{\textendash}time interaction. A simulation study is carried out which quantifies the bias present in each test across a variety of population movement scenarios. Results show a positive relationship between population shift bias and the heterogeneity in population growth across all the tests. They also demonstrate variability in the size of the bias across the three tests for space{\textendash}time interaction considered. Finally, the results illustrate that population shift bias can be a serious problem for short study periods. Collectively, these findings suggest that an unbiased approach to assessing the significance of space{\textendash}time interaction test results is needed whenever spatially heterogeneous population change is identified within a study area.},

  abstract = {In this article, we propose a new approach for assessing the extent to which schools are successful in mixing students from different backgrounds. It is based on a comparison of variation in the composition of the student population in small-scale residential neighborhoods with variation in the composition of the student population at local schools. From this we compute a measure that corresponds to the number of small scale neighborhoods that needs to be sampled in order to arrive at the observed mixing of students in schools. Using this measure, we can show that in 2012, in a large majority of Swedish municipalities, schools are successful in mixing students from different types of neighborhoods, but in 25\% of the municipalities mixing is not so good. Three fundamental determinants of mixing are large-scale residential segregation, average school size, and number of students in the municipality. These factors are strong determinants of mixing and when they are included, other contextual factors provide very little additional explanation of why mixing varies among municipalities. With the fundamental determinants excluded the contextual factors have an effect. For example, tertiary education, many migrants, and high proportions of independent schools tend to lower the level of mixing.},

Despite the substantial changes that have occurred in metropolitan America from 1970 to 2010, we find remarkable persistence in the rank of census tracts by population density, income, education, and house prices, with many MSAs having rank correlations of over 0.75. Racial and ethnic variables appear to be less persistent, but all the variables exhibit a significant trend toward more stability over time. Even in the presence of large shocks to the metropolitan economy, a majority of MSAs retain the same basic spatial hierarchy they had decades ago. We also find that disturbances to hierarchies are highly spatially correlated. This pattern of stability and change has significant implications for how we analyze and understand urban areas and the way they change.},

In this paper I use high-resolution data based on unemployment insurance records to show that employment in US metropolitan areas is not centralized but is spatially concentrated. Unlike residents, who form a continuous surface covering most parts of each MSA, jobs have a bimodal spatial distribution, with most blocks containing no jobs whatsoever and a small number having extremely high employment densities. Across the 100 largest MSAs about 75\% of jobs are located on the 10\% of built land in Census blocks with at least twice as many jobs as people. Further, most of these jobs are in clustered business districts with more than 10 contiguous employment blocks. These relative proportions are extremely consistent across metro areas, even though cities vary greatly in the physical density at which they are constructed. Motivated by these empirical regularities, I introduce an algorithm to identify contiguous business districts and classify them into four major types. Based solely on the relative densities of employment and population, this algorithm is both simpler to implement and more flexible than current approaches, requiring no metro-specific tuning parameters and no assumptions about urban form. As one output, it provides an inductive, datadriven method of identifying city centers for the purposes of urban economic analysis.},

First, we examine neighborhoods that are harsh on children's development: those characterized by high levels of violence, incarceration, and lead exposure. Second, we examine potential supportive or offsetting mechanisms that promote children's development, such as informal social control, cohesion among neighbors, and organizational participation. Census tract mobility estimates from linked income tax and Census records are merged with surveys and administrative records in Chicago. We find that exposure to neighborhood violence, incarceration, and lead combine to independently predict poor black boys' later incarceration as adults and lower income rank relative to their parents, and poor black girls' teenage motherhood. Features of neighborhood social organization matter less, but are selectively important. Results for poor whites also show that toxic environments independently predict lower social mobility, as do features of social organization, to a lesser extent. Overall, our measures contribute a 76\% relative increase in explained variance for black male incarceration beyond that of concentrated poverty and other standard characteristics, an 18\% increase for black male income rank (70\% for whites), and a 17\% increase for teenage motherhood of black girls (40\% for whites).}

To this end, we apply inequality indices over regions to incidences, infection related mortality, and infection fatality rates. If avoiding of inequality in health is an important political goal, a metric must be implemented to track geographical inequality over time.                                         Methods               The relative and absolute Gini index as well as the Theil index are used to quantify inequality. Data are taken from international data bases. Absolute counts are transformed to rates adjusted for population size.                                         Results               Comparing continents, the absolute Gini index shows an unfavorable development in four continents since February 2020. In contrast, the relative Gini as well as the Theil index support the interpretation of less inequality between European countries compared to other continents. Infection fatality rates within the EU as well as within the U.S. express comparable improvement towards more equality (as measured by both Gini indices).                                         Conclusions               The use of inequality indices to monitor changes in geographic inequality over time for key health indicators is a valuable tool to inform public health policies. The absolute and relative Gini index behave complementary and should be reported simultaneously in order to gain a meta-perspective on very complex dynamics.},

The resulting collection of so-called redlining maps is one of the preeminent urban and racial surveys conducted in the history of the United States. We at the Digital Innovation Lab of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are building a national digital collection of these paper maps, currently housed at the National Archives in Washington D.C., and using this collection to explore the use of semiautomated feature extraction techniques on large historical content. Our methodology is based on supervised, classification image processing techniques. We use a commercial tool called ArcScan, an extension to the popular ESRI ArcGIS software, to extract tens of thousands of neighborhood boundaries that can then be saved as vector overlays and used to drive the development of new types of research interfaces. We conclude the paper with examples of these new types of interfaces. Finally, we describe the potential impact of linking vectorized national collections together and the need for further research in this area, including using hybrid approaches that involve large-scale crowdsourcing.},

It is shown that the comparison of inequality among neighborhood and specific provincial factors open a new manner of analysis that can shed light on the terms of policy recommendations, specially on those identified as place-based oriented, by introducing a new perspective about what is the relevant place on which the policy has to be set in order to achieve regional inequalities reductions.},

In Europe the ruptures of the past decade threaten not only European unity but, in some countries, liberal democracy itself. In China, the Party's need to contain the divisions wrought by capitalism will define the nation's future.

  abstract = {One of the most enduring and contentious debates in education circles concerns the best way to hold schools and districts accountable for improving outcomes for students and closing achievement gaps. Lawmakers, teachers, district administrators, parents, and other stakeholders--all with strong and differing opinions--have wrestled for decades with questions about the appropriate role of the federal government compared with that of states and school districts in the operation of schools and the measurement of their success. The Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, signed into law in December 2015, was in many ways the culmination of the accountability movement. Under ESSA, states must hold schools accountable for student performance in English language arts, or ELA, and mathematics; a second academic indicator, such as growth in ELA and mathematics; progress in achieving English language proficiency; high school graduation rates, if applicable; and at least one measure of school quality or student success. In addition, states are required to disaggregate these indicators, excluding English language proficiency, by individual subgroups of students, including those from low-income families, those from major racial and ethnic groups, those with disabilities, and English language learners. ESSA's new requirements build on the history of school accountability, which began at the state level in the 1990s amid a broader effort to measure school performance. The No Child Left Behind Act, or NCLB--the 2001 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA--increased the federal role in accountability. ESSA, the most recent reauthorization of ESEA, gives states greater flexibility in designing more holistic accountability systems that take into account multiple indicators of school success, while continuing to hold schools accountable for academic achievement. This report analyzes the measures that states currently include in their accountability systems and examines how state systems compare with the new law's provisions, which will take effect in the 2017-18 school year. To this end, the Center for American Progress analyzed ESEA flexibility waivers and accountability workbooks, supplementing the data from those sources with information and materials from state departments of education. The authors find that statewide accountability measures fall into one of seven main categories of indicators: achievement indicators, such as proficiency in reading and mathematics; student growth indicators in multiple academic subjects; English language acquisition indicators; early warning indicators, such as chronic absenteeism; persistence indicators, such as graduation rates; college- and career-ready indicators, such as participation in and performance on college entry exams; and other indicators, such as access to the arts. The following are appended: (1) Methodology; (2) Indicator analysis; (3) Weighting analysis; and (4) Sources. (This report is part of a series on implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act.)},

Existing methods rely on manual adjustments of the results to ensure high quality, making them difficult to be monitored, hard to apply to different territories, and onerous to produce in terms of required work-hours. We propose an approach to automatise all stages of the delineation procedure and improve the final results, building upon a state-of-the-art stochastic search procedure that ensures optimal allocation of municipalities/counties to LMAs while keeping good global indicators: a pre-processing layer clusters adjoining municipalities with strong commuting flows to constrain the initial search space of the stochastic search, and a multi-criteria heuristic corrects common deficiencies that derive from global maximisation approaches or simple greedy heuristics. It produces high quality LMAs with optimal local characteristics. To demonstrate this methodology and assess the improvement achieved, we apply it to define LMAs in Spain based on the latest commuting data.},

It includes, among others, (generalised) linear models, (generalised) additive models, smoothing-spline models, state-space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatio-temporal models, log-Gaussian Cox-processes, geostatistical and geoadditive models. In this paper we consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form due to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, both in terms of convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations},

Based on this argument, we then specify a statistical model overcoming methodological problems that have hampered earlier work. Estimates based on US data con rm that racial/ ethnic segregation interacts with structural shifts in society to concentrate poverty. By 1990, a powerful interaction between residential segregation and income inequality had emerged to spatially isolate the poor, an interaction the effects of which were buttressed by weaker interactions between segregation, rising class segregation, and stagnating mean incomes. Our analysis reveals how underlying shifts in socio-economic structure can have very different effects on the concentration of poverty experienced by different groups, depending on the degree of racial/ethnic segregation they experience.},

Segregation was achieved by means of different mechanisms at different times and places, beginning with targeted violence directed at African Americans followed later by discrimination in real estate and banking using devices such as deed restrictions, restrictive covenants, and racial redlining, practices that were institutionalized in federal policies during the New Deal. By 1977, however, discrimination had been outlawed in most US markets and average black segregation began to decline. The declines, however, were inversely proportional to the size of the black community. As Latinos grew in number after the 1970s, levels of racial isolation within Hispanic neighborhoods also rose. At the same time, class segregation increased, especially among families with children, and inequalities of wealth and income grew to create a polarized urban geography. High concentrations of affluence now prevail for affluent whites and Asians living in wealthy post-industrial coastal areas, with high concentrations of poverty prevailing for poor blacks and Hispanics in older, declining industrial areas in the Midwest and the South, which also contain pockets of white and Asian poverty. The new political geography of race and class effectively denies blacks and Hispanics their access to quality education and undermines their lifetime earning prospects to create self-perpetuating system of social and economic stratification.},

  abstract = {Empirical studies on regional economic development in Europe traditionally concluded that income per capita converged at a steady rate of about 2\%. Recent studies on regional disparity have repudiated these findings: in the 1980s convergence was absent in Europe. This paper adds some new empirical findings. Firstly, convergence re-emerged at the end of the 1980s and in the 1990s. Secondly, growth was a combined result of poor regions catching up with richer ones, peripheral regions growing faster than central ones, innovation and of technology spillovers. Thirdly, by conditioning so-called |-convergence, it is found that convergence was most pronounced between regions that were localised far away from each other and that were dissimilar in terms of innovative activity, technological specialisation and the amount of spillovers received. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Ideal estimates of the intergenerational elasticity (IGE) in income require a large panel of income data covering the entire working lifetimes for two generations. Previous studies have demonstrated that using short panels and covering only certain portions of the lifecycle can lead to considerable bias. I address these biases by using the PSID and constructing long time averages centered at age 40 in both generations. I find that the IGE in family income in the U.S. is likely greater than 0.6 suggesting a relatively low rate of intergenerational mobility in the U.S. I find similar sized estimates for the IGE in labor income. These estimates support the prior findings of Mazumder (2005a, b) and are also similar to comparable estimates reported by Mitnik et al. (2015). In contrast, a recent influential study by Chetty et al. (2014) using tax data that begins in 1996, estimates the IGE in family income for the U.S. to be just 0.344 implying a much higher rate of intergenerational mobility. I demonstrate that despite the seeming advantages of extremely large samples of administrative tax data, the age structure and limited panel dimension of the data used by Chetty et al. leads to considerable downward bias in estimating the IGE. I further demonstrate that the sensitivity checks in Chetty et al. regarding the age at which children's income is measured, and the length of the time average of parent income used to estimate the IGE, are also flawed due to these data limitations. There are also concerns that tax data, unlike survey data, may not adequately reflect all sources of family income. Estimates of the rank-rank slope, Chetty et al.'s preferred estimator, are more robust to the limitations of the tax data but are also downward biased and modestly overstate mobility. However, Chetty et al.'s main findings of sizable geographic differences within the U.S. in rank mobility, are unlikely to be affected by these biases. I conclude that researchers should continue to use both the IGE and rank based measures depending on their preferred concept of mobility. It also important for researchers to have adequate coverage of key portions of the lifecycle and to consider the possible drawbacks of using administrative data.},

Based on relational data structures and advanced web-based archiving and delivery tools, the PSID has a publicly available web-based facility for users worldwide to create customized data extracts and codebooks, based on nearly 70,000 variables from over 70,000 individuals over 44 years. This paper provides an overview of the PSID and its supplemental studies, the Disability and Use of Time Supplement, the Child Development Supplement, and the Transition into Adulthood study, and describes features and recent enhancements that have increased the potential of the archive for studying life course development.},

Despite the heterogeneities of US states, counties, and towns, the share of the vote that Trump received in the 2020 US presidential election is found at each level to be a strong and robust predictor of a lower June 2022 Covid-19 vaccination initiation rate, even after adjusting for sociodemographic composition, spatial effects, and diverse provisioning- and takeup-related factors. At each of the three subnational levels, the Trump 2020 vote share was also correlated more closely than the Trump 2016 vote share or the Romney 2012 vote share with the June 2022 Covid-19 vaccination initiation rate.},

You're running faster but not moving closer to your goals? Everything is so much harder than it used to be? As high achievers, we've been conditioned to believe that the path to success is paved with relentless work. That if we want to overachieve, we have to overexert, overthink, and overdo. That if we aren't perpetually exhausted, we're not doing enough. But lately, working hard is more exhausting than ever. And the more depleted we get, the more effort it takes to make progress. Stuck in an endless loop of "Zoom, eat, sleep, repeat," we're often working twice as hard to achieve half as much. Getting ahead doesn't have to be as hard as we make it. No matter what challenges or obstacles we face, there is a better way: instead of pushing ourselves harder, we can find an easier path. Effortless offers actionable advice for making the most essential activities the easiest ones, so you can achieve the results you want, without burning out. Effortless teaches you how to: Turn tedious tasks into enjoyable rituals Prevent frustration by solving problems before they arise Set a sustainable pace instead of powering through Make one-time choices that eliminate many future decisions Simplify your processes by removing unnecessary steps Make relationships easier to maintain and manage And much more The effortless way isn't the lazy way. It's the smart way. It may even be the only way. Not every hard thing in life can be made easy. But we can make it easier to do more of what matters most"--},

  abstract = {Bestselling author and acclaimed linguist John McWhorter argues that an illiberal neoracism, disguised as antiracism, is hurting black communities and weakening the social fabric. Americans of good will on both the left and the right are secretly asking themselves the same question: how has the conversation on race in America gone so crazy? We're told to read books and listen to music by people of color but that wearing certain clothes is "appropriation." We hear that being white automatically gives you privilege and that being Black makes you a victim. We want to speak up but fear we'll be seen as unwoke, or worse, labeled a racist. According to John McWhorter, the problem is that a well-meaning but pernicious form of antiracism has become, not a progressive ideology, but a religion--and one that's illogical, unreachable, and unintentionally neoracist. In Woke Racism, McWhorter reveals the workings of this new religion, from the original sin of "white privilege" and the weaponization of cancel culture to ban heretics, to the evangelical fervor of the "woke mob." He shows how this religion that claims to "dismantle racist structures" is actually harming his fellow Black Americans by infantilizing Black people, setting Black students up for failure, and passing policies that disproportionately damage Black communities. The new religion might be called "antiracism," but it features a racial essentialism that's barely distinguishable from racist arguments of the past. Fortunately for Black America, and for all of us, it's not too late to push back against woke racism. McWhorter shares scripts and encouragement with those trying to deprogram friends and family. And most importantly, he offers a roadmap to justice that actually will help, not hurt, Black America},

In this paper, we use a novel luminosity-based measure of GDP per capita to study regional convergence and spatial dependence across 274 subnational regions of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the 1998{\textendash}2012 period. Specifically, we first evaluate the usefulness of this new luminosity indicator in the context of ASEAN regions. Results show that almost 60 percent of the differences in (official) GDP per capita can be predicted by this luminosity-based measure of GDP. Next, given its potential usefulness for predicting regional GDP, we evaluate the spatio-temporal dynamics of regional inequality across ASEAN. Results indicate that although there is an overall (average) process of regional convergence, regional inequality within most countries has not significantly decreased. When evaluating the patterns of spatial dependence, we find increasing spatial dependence over time and stable spatial clusters (hotspots and coldspots) that are located across multiple national boundaries. Taken together, these results provide a new and more disaggregated perspective of the integration process of the ASEAN community.},

The datadriven component of IDM employs a flexible empirical sampling approach to acquire information on the data densities of individual ancillary classes, and it uses the ratio of class densities to redistribute population to sub-source zone areas. A summary statistics table characterizing the resulting dasymetric map can be used to compare the quality of the output of different IDM parameterizations. A case study of four population variables is used to demonstrate IDM and provide a visual and quantitative error assessment comparing various IDM parameterizations with areal weighting and conventional ``binary'' dasymetric mapping. Intelligent dasymetric mapping outperforms areal weighting, and certain IDM parameterizations outperform binary dasymetric mapping.},

The process of dasymetric mapping typically involves the disaggregation of population data encoded in choropleth map form using an ancillary spatial data set, most commonly either an area-class map or satellite image. The functional relationship between the ancillary data and the statistical surface being mapped may be specified a priori by the researcher or estimated using a variety of statistical techniques.

  abstract = {Neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is associated to increased individual risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD). However, the value of this association for causal inference is uncertain. Moreover, neighborhoods are often defined by available administrative boundaries without evaluating in which degree these boundaries embrace a relevant socio-geographical context that condition individual differences in IHD risk. Therefore, we performed an analysis of variance, and also compared the associations obtained by conventional multilevel analyses and by quasi-experimental family-based design that provides stronger evidence for causal inference. Linking the Swedish Multi-Generation Register to several other national registers, we analyzed 184,931 families embracing 415,540 full brothers 45e64 years old in 2004, and residing in 8408 small-area market statistics (SAMS) considered as ``neighborhoods'' in our study. We investigated the association between low neighborhood income (categorized in groups by deciles) and IHD risk in the next four years. We distinguished between family mean and intrafamilial-centered low neighborhood income, which allowed us to investigate both unrelated individuals from different families and full brothers within families. We applied multilevel logistic regression techniques to obtain odds ratios (OR), variance partition coefficients (VPC) and 95\% credible intervals (CI). In unrelated individuals a decile unit increase of low neighborhood income increased individual IHD risk (OR {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.04, 95\% CI: 1.03e1.07). In the intrafamilial analysis this association was reduced (OR {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.02, 95\% CI: 1.02e1.04). Low neighborhood income seems associated with IHD risk in middle-aged men. However, despite the family-based design, we cannot exclude residual confounding by genetic and non-shared environmental factors. Besides, the low neighborhood level VPC {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.5\% suggest that the SAMS are a rather inappropriate construct of the socio-geographic context that conditions individual variance in IHD risk. In contrast the high family level VPC {$\frac{1}{4}$} 20.1\% confirms the relevance of the family context for understanding IHD risk.},

We find that income inequality across block groups plays a key role in determining the level of property crime. As the income gap with one's poorest neighbouring block group widens, the level of property crime in the richer block group increases. Also, the poorest block group in an area tends to experience less property crime, holding all else constant.},

  abstract = {Several spatial and non-spatial Cross-Validation (CV) methods have been used to perform map validation when additional sampling for validation purposes is not possible, yet it is unclear in which situations one CV method might be preferred over the other. Three factors have been identified as determinants of the performance of CV methods for map validation: the prediction area (geographical interpolation vs. extrapolation), the sampling pattern and the landscape spatial autocorrelation. In this study, we propose a new CV strategy that takes the geographical prediction space into account, and test how the new method compares with other established CV methods under different configurations of these three factors. We propose a variation of Leave-One-Out (LOO) CV for map validation, called Nearest Neighbour Distance Matching (NNDM) LOO CV, in which the nearest neighbour distance distribution function between the test and training data during the CV process is matched to the nearest neighbour distance distribution function between the target prediction and training points. Using random forest as a machine learning algorithm, we then examine the suitability of NNDM LOO CV as well as the established LOO (non-spatial) and buffered-LOO (bLOO, spatial) CV methods in two simulations with varying prediction areas, landscape autocorrelation and sampling distributions. LOO CV provided good map accuracy estimates in landscapes with short autocorrelation ranges, or when estimating geographical interpolation map accuracy with randomly distributed samples. bLOO CV yielded realistic error estimates when estimating map accuracy in new prediction areas, but generally overestimated geographical interpolation errors. NNDM LOO CV returned reliable estimates in all scenarios we considered. While LOO and bLOO CV provided reliable map accuracy estimates only in certain situations, our newly proposed NNDM LOO CV method returned robust estimates and generalised to LOO and bLOO CV whenever these methods were the most appropriate approach. Our work recognises the necessity of considering the geographical prediction space when designing CV-based methods for map validation.},

  abstract = {"One of the world's leading economists of inequality, Branko Milanovic presents a bold new account of the dynamics that drive inequality on a global scale. Drawing on vast data sets and cutting-edge research, he explains the benign and malign forces that make inequality rise and fall within and among nations. He also reveals who has been helped the most by globalization, who has been held back, and what policies might tilt the balance toward economic justice. Global Inequality takes us back hundreds of years, and as far around the world as data allow, to show that inequality moves in cycles, fueled by war and disease, technological disruption, access to education, and redistribution. The recent surge of inequality in the West has been driven by the revolution in technology, just as the Industrial Revolution drove inequality 150 years ago. But even as inequality has soared within nations, it has fallen dramatically among nations, as middle-class incomes in China and India have drawn closer to the stagnating incomes of the middle classes in the developed world. A more open migration policy would reduce global inequality even further. Both American and Chinese inequality seem well entrenched and self-reproducing, though it is difficult to predict if current trends will be derailed by emerging plutocracy, populism, or war. For those who want to understand how we got where we are, where we may be heading, and what policies might help reverse that course, Milanovic's compelling explanation is the ideal place to start."--Provided by publisher},

Its fertile floodplain allowed for rise to the great civilization of ancient Egypt, but for millennia the location of its headwaters was shrouded in mystery. Pharaonic and Roman attempts to find it were stymied by a giant labyrinthine swamp, and subsequent expeditions got no further. In the 19th century, the discovery and translation of the Rosetta Stone set off a frenzy of interest in ancient Egypt. At the same time, European powers sent off waves of explorations intended to map the unknown corners of the globe - and extend their colonial empires. Two British men - Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke - were sent by the Royal Geographical Society to claim the prize for England. Burton was already famous for being the first non-Muslim to travel to Mecca, disguised as an Arab chieftain. He spoke twenty-nine languages, was a decorated soldier, and literally wrote the book on sword-fighting techniques for the British Army. He was also mercurial, subtle, and an iconoclastic atheist. Speke was a young aristocrat and Army officer determined to make his mark, passionate about hunting, Burton's opposite in temperament and beliefs. From the start the two men clashed, Speke chafing under Burton's command and Burton disapproving of Speke's ignorance of the people whose lands through which they traveled. They would endure tremendous hardships, illness, and constant setbacks. Two years in, deep in the African interior, Burton became too sick to press on, but Speke did, and claimed he found the source in a great lake that he christened Lake Victoria. When they returned to England, Speke rushed to take credit, disparaging Burton. Burton disputed his claim, and Speke launched another expedition to Africa to prove it. The two became venomous enemies, with the public siding with the more charismatic Burton, to Speke's great envy. The day before they were to publicly debate, Speke shot himself. Yet there was a third man on both expeditions, his name obscured by imperial annals, whose exploits were even more extraordinary. This was Sidi Mubarak Bombay, who was enslaved and shipped from his home village in East Africa to India. When the man who purchased him died, he made his way into the local Sultan's army, and eventually traveled back to Africa, where he used his resourcefulness, linguistic prowess and raw courage to forge a living as a guide. Without his talents, it is likely that neither Englishman would have come close to the headwaters of the Nile, or perhaps even survived. In RIVER OF THE GODS Candice Millard has written another peerless story of courage and adventure, set against the backdrop of the race to exploit Africa by the colonial powers"--},

  abstract = {Predictive vegetation modeling (PVM), is defined as predicting the distribution of vegetation across a landscape based on the relationship between the spatial distribution of vegetation and environmental variables. PVM requires digital maps of the environmental variables, as well as spatial information on the vegetation attribute of interest (e.g., species, type, abundance), usually from a sample of locations. Often these predictive models are developed using traditional statistical methods and are based on the implicit assumption that the distribution of vegetation is random and, therefore, each observation is independent. This approach violates one of the basic tenets of geography, the direct relationship between distance and likeness, as well as of ecological theory, that elements of an ecosystem close to one another are more likely to be influenced by the same generating process and will therefore be similar. Some of the spatial structure can be explained by the predictor variables used in the model. Environmental variables such as precipitation, temperature and elevation exhibit spatial dependence, some of which is responsible for spatial clustering in vegetation distribution, but remaining spatial dependence can result from either unmeasured environmental variables or biotic processes that cause spatial clustering. Spatial dependence in biogeographical data has been recently identified as an important area of future PVM research, and many studies have begun to explore ways to incorporate spatial dependence in predictive models. Here we review the different approaches to incorporating spatial dependence into predictive vegetation models focusing on four statistical methods: autoregressive models, geostatistics, geographically weighted regression, and parameter estimation models. Autoregressive models may be more capable of describing the fine-scaled spatial dependence that results from local biotic factors, such as disturbance, competition, or dispersal, while geostatistical methods may be more suitable for modeling broad-scale spatial dependence. The other methods focus on global and local parameter estimation in the presence of spatially structured or nonstationary data. While this review focuses on incorporating spatial dependence into statistical models for predictive purposes, explicitly including spatial dependence in models can also aid in clarifying the effect of different explanatory variables, thereby improving inferences.},

A data-driven geography may be emerging in response to the wealth of georeferenced data flowing from sensors and people in the environment. Although this may seem revolutionary, in fact it may be better described as evolutionary. Some of the issues raised by data-driven geography have in fact been longstanding issues in geographic research, namely, large data volumes, dealing with populations and messy data, and tensions between idiographic versus nomothetic knowledge. The belief that spatial context matters is a major theme in geographic thought and a major motivation behind approaches such as time geography, disaggregate spatial statistics and GIScience. There is potential to use Big Data to inform both geographic knowledge-discovery and spatial modeling. However, there are challenges, such as how to formalize geographic knowledge to clean data and to ignore spurious patterns, and how to build data-driven models that are both true and understandable.},

Yet, former residential neighbourhoods are likely to have lingering effects beyond those of the current one and are dependent on exposure times and number of moves. This paper tests to what extent this blind spot induced a misestimation of neighbourhood effects for individuals with differential residential histories. Ultimately, we develop a methodological framework for studying the temporal dynamics of neighbourhood effects, capable of dealing with residential histories (moving behaviour, the passage of time and temporal exposure to different neighbourhoods). We apply cross-classified multi-level models (residents nested in current and former neighbourhoods) to analyse longitudinal individual-level population data from Dutch Statistics, covering fine-grained measures of residential histories. Our systematic comparison to conventional models reveals the necessity of including a temporal dimension: our models reveal an overestimation of the effect of the current neighbourhood by 16{\textendash}30\%, and an underestimation of the total body of neighbourhood effects by at least 13{\textendash}24\%. Our results show that neighbourhood effects are lingering, long-lasting and structural and also cannot be confined to a single point in time.},

Past studies have however mainly focused on the task of applying appropriate methods for ranking locations, with few focusing on the issue of how to define selection methods or threshold rules for hotspot identification. The primary goal of this paper is to introduce a multiple testing-based approach to the problem of selecting hotspots. Following the recent developments in the literature, two testing procedures are studied under a Bayesian framework: Bayesian test with weights (BTW) and a Bayesian test controlling for the posterior false discovery rate (FDR) or false negative rate (FNR). The hypotheses tests are implemented on the basis of two random effect or Bayesian models, namely, the hierarchical Poisson/Gamma or Negative Binomial model and the hierarchical Poisson/Lognormal model. A dataset of highway{\textendash}railway grade crossings is used as an application example to illustrate the proposed procedures incorporating both the posterior distribution of accident frequency and the posterior distribution of ranks. Results on the effects of various decision parameters used in hotspot identification procedures are discussed.},

Often, DOTs use relatively straightforward methods to detect high crash sites; these methods, however, may not be accurate. The objectives of this study are to develop two different methodologies: (a) a geographic information system (GIS)-based method to detect crash hot spots and (b) a spatial regression method with structured and unstructured random effects in continuous space to investigate the intersection-level factors that influence the concentration of fatal injury crashes. Using injury and property damage only (PDO) crash data from Tucson, Arizona, this study shows that spatial dependence plays a strong role during the analyses of road-traffic crashes. These spatial dependencies, accounted through spatial autocorrelation, help to detect statistically significant clusters of crashes involving fatalities or severe or minor injuries, in a GIS framework. This study also develops statistical models of severe- and minor-injury crashes, using classical negative binomial (NB) and Bayesian spatial statistical methods incorporating spatially structured and unstructured random effects. The coefficient estimates from a Bayesian framework are similar to those from NB estimation, but with better precision. The model that includes spatial correlations also indicates the potential to reduce the bias associated with model misspecification by changing the estimate of the annual average daily traffic coefficients. This study's results also indicate that spatially structured correlation is quite significant in cases of crashes involving minor injury or PDO and that unstructured effects are somewhat significant at the intersection-level for cases of severe-injury crashes.},

  abstract = {Neighbourhood socioeconomic change is a complex phenomenon which is driven by multiple processes. Most research has focused on the role of urban-level processes, which lead to an exchange of relative positions among neighbourhoods of a single metropolitan area. Consequently, the effects of structural processes on neighbourhood socioeconomic change, such as overall income growth or decline, and increasing inequality, have been neglected. This is reflected in the standard methodological practices; the common measures of neighbourhood change exclude the effect of overall growth or decline and confound the effects of urban processes with the effect of increase in inequality. This paper proposes a method that was originally developed for understanding income mobility of individuals, to decompose total neighbourhood socioeconomic change measured in absolute terms into its contributing components. The approach enables to take account of all processes that generate neighbourhood socioeconomic change, while distinguishing between them. The method is demonstrated in an empirical analysis of neighbourhood socioeconomic change across 22 metropolitan areas in the US. The findings indicate that structural processes can be most substantial in generating change. Neighbourhood socioeconomic change in `superstar cities' is mostly generated by the growth in overall incomes, with a relatively low contribution of increasing inequality. Conversely, in declining cities it is mostly driven by overall decline and increasing inequality. An additional finding relates to the interaction between urban processes and increasing inequality. These processes work in opposite directions such that any increase in positions of low-income neighbourhoods can be totally offset by an income decrease due to increasing inequality.},

  abstract = {Recent research has shown an association between monthly law enforcement drug seizure events and accidental drug overdose deaths using cross-sectional data in a single state, whereby increased seizures correlated with more deaths. In this study, we conduct statistical analysis of street-level data on law enforcement drug seizures, along with street-level data on fatal and non-fatal overdose events, to determine possible micro-level causal associations between opioid-related drug seizures and overdoses. For this purpose, we introduce a novel, modified two-process Knox test that controls for self-excitation to measure clustering of overdoses nearby in space and time following law enforcement seizures. We observe a small, but statistically significant (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), effect of 17.7 excess non-fatal overdoses per 1000 law enforcement seizures within three weeks and 250\,m of a seizure. We discuss the potential causal mechanism for this association along with policy implications.},

However, the positive predictive value (PPV), ie the probability that they have the disease given a positive test result, is rarely equal to one. To assist their patients, doctors must explain the chance that they do in fact have the disease. However, physicians frequently miscalculate the PPV as the sensitivity and/or misinterpret the PPV, which results in increased anxiety in patients and generates unnecessary tests and consultations.

The widespread decline in migration rates across a large number of subpopulations suggests that broad-based economic forces are likely responsible for the decrease. An obvious question is the extent to which the recent housing market contraction and the recession may have caused this downward trend in migration: after all, relocation activity often involves both housing market activity and changes in employment. However, we find relatively small roles for both of these cyclical factors. While we will suggest a few other possible explanations for the recent decrease in migration, the puzzle remains. Finally, we compare U.S. migration to other developed countries. Despite the steady decline in U.S. migration, the commonly held belief that Americans are more mobile than their European counterparts still appears to hold true.},

  abstract = {Segregation on the basis of race or ethnicity is one of the most enduring and pervasive inequities in US public education. School segregation is determined not only by residential sorting and families' preferences but by local policy choices such as the drawing of school attendance boundaries. This report examines the role of individual school attendance boundaries in perpetuating racial and ethnic segregation in urban school systems. Our findings show that in many cases, small changes to the attendance boundaries of neighboring schools could make a big difference for school integration. We analyze census and school attendance boundary map data, evaluating the boundary lines dividing attendance rights between every pair of neighboring public schools in US metropolitan areas. We find more than 2,000 pairs of neighboring public schools that are racially unequal, both in residential demographics and school enrollment. We also find that inequality between these schools{\textemdash}many of which are within the jurisdiction of the same school district{\textemdash}exists not only in terms of racial and ethnic demographics but with regard to school staffing, educational program offerings, student discipline rates, and mean student achievement on standardized exams. Unequal school attendance zones perpetuate racial and ethnic segregation and amplify inequality between students of color and their white peers. Furthermore, many unequal school boundaries are linked to the New Deal's Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) redlining maps, a notorious instance of explicit and consequential racist federal policy. Averaging across our list of racially unequal school boundaries, we find that the side with more Black or Hispanic residents is more likely to have a HOLC grade rated ``hazardous'' than the side with fewer Black or Hispanic residents, which is more likely to be rated ``best'' or ``desirable.'' This evidence suggests that many of the racially unequal school boundaries in our data are direct vestiges of our cities' historic roots of explicit racism, not just an artifact of recent individual household choices. Persistent school segregation is the legacy of racist housing policy and the product of intentional decisions by the local governments that determine school attendance zones. Racially unequal school boundaries are highly inefficient preservations of old, problematic policy, and for many of these unequal boundaries, redrawing the line would remedy much of the inequality between schools. Policymakers invested in improving integration can use our novel approach to identifying unequal boundaries to create sustainable solutions to racial and ethnic inequality in public education.},

To reconcile this seeming paradox, we sketch out and test empirically a hybrid model of regional growth that draws on the regional Kuznets curve and incorporates aspects of cumulative causation and neoclassical convergence. In both CEE and the `old' EU15, regional convergence is strongly linked to the level of national development, non-linearly. But while in the EU15 convergence speeds-up at intermediate/high levels of development, in CEE we find divergence at intermediate levels of national development and no significant return to convergence thereafter. Although this may show that overall development levels are not sufficient yet to mobilise regional convergence, it is also possible that non-convergence is attributable to centripetal forces instigated by the process of transition.},

To evaluate combined individual- and community-level interventions to reduce underage drinking by American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youths on rural California Indian reservations. Methods. Individual-level interventions included brief motivational interviewing and psychoeducation for Tribal youths. Community-level interventions included community mobilization and awareness activities, as well as restricting alcohol sales to minors. To test effects, we compared 7 waves of California Healthy Kids Survey data (2002{\textendash}2015) for 9thand 11th-grade AI/AN and non-AI/AN students in intervention area schools with California AI/AN students outside the intervention area (n = 617, n = 33 469, and n = 976, respectively). Results. Pre- to postintervention mean past 30-day drinking frequency declined among current drinkers in the intervention group (8.4{\textendash}6.3 days) relative to comparison groups. Similarly, heavy episodic drinking frequency among current drinkers declined in the intervention group (7.0{\textendash}4.8 days) versus the comparison groups. Conclusions. This study documented significant, sustained past 30-day drinking or heavy episodic drinking frequency reductions among AI/AN 9th- and 11th-grade current drinkers in rural California Indian reservation communities exposed to multilevel interventions.},

  abstract = {Detection of disease clusters is an important tool in epidemiology that can help to identify risk factors associated with the disease and in understanding its etiology. In this article we propose a method for the detection of spatial clusters where the locations of a set of cases and a set of controls are available. The method is based on local indicators of spatial association functions (LISA functions), particularly on the development of a local version of the product density, which is a second-order characteristic of spatial point processes. The behavior of the method is evaluated and compared with Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic by means of a simulation study. It is shown that the LISA method yields high sensitivity and specificity when it is used to detect simulated clusters of different sizes and shapes. It also performs better than the spatial scan statistic when they are used to detect clusters of irregular shape; however, it presents relatively high type I error in situations where the number of cases is high. Both methods are applied for detecting spatial clusters of kidney disease in the city of Valencia, Spain, in the year 2008. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Spatial proximity to homicide is strongly related to increased homicide rates, adjusting for internal neighborhood characteristics and prior homicide. Concentrated disadvantage and low collective efficacy{\textendash}defined as the linkage of social control and cohesion{\textendash}also independently predict increased homicide. Local organizations, voluntary associations, and friend/kinship networks appear to be important only insofar as they promote the collective efficacy of residents in achieving social control and cohesion. Spatial dynamics coupled with neighborhood inequalities in social and economic capacity are therefore consequential for explaining urban violence. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

To precisely analyze co-location relationships in a micro-scale space, this study develops a new statistical method by addressing the limitations of the ordinary cross K function method. The objectives of this paper are, first, to formulate an exact statistical method for analyzing co-location along streets in a central district constrained by a street network; second, to imple\- ment this statistical method in computational procedures. Third, this method is extended to the analysis of repulsive-location, i.e. phenomena of stores locating repulsively among different types of stores. Fourth, the paper shows a graph-theoretic diagram illustrat\- ing the spatial structure of stores in a central district consisting of bilateral, unilateral co-location and repulsive-location. Last, the pro\- posed method is applied to eight different types of stores in a trendy district in Tokyo. The results show that the method is useful for revealing the spatial structure consisting of co-location and repulsive-location in the central district.},

However, these do not capture the income segregation experience implied by the rich social interactions that happen in places that may relate to individual choices, opportunities, and mobility behavior. Using a large-scale high-resolution mobility data set of 4.5 million mobile phone users and 1.1 million places in 11 large American cities, we show that income segregation experienced in places and by individuals can differ greatly even within close spatial proximity. To further understand these fine-grained income segregation patterns, we introduce a Schelling extension of a well-known mobility model, and show that experienced income segregation is associated with an individual's tendency to explore new places (place exploration) as well as places with visitors from different income groups (social exploration). Interestingly, while the latter is more strongly associated with demographic characteristics, the former is more strongly associated with mobility behavioral variables. Our results suggest that mobility behavior plays an important role in experienced income segregation of individuals. To measure this form of income segregation, urban researchers should take into account mobility behavior and not only residential patterns.},

The few prior studies conducted in this area used relatively large spatial units; here we use highly resolved units from Melbourne, Australia (Statistical Area level 1 [SA1] units: mean land area = 0.5 km2; SD = 2.2 km2), in order to assess different micro-scale spatial relationships for on- and off-premise outlets. Methods: Bayesian conditional autoregressive Poisson models were used to assess cross-sectional relationships of three-year counts of alcohol-related crashes (2010-2012) attended by Ambulance Victoria paramedics to densities of bars, restaurants, and off-premise outlets controlling for other land use, demographic and roadway characteristics. Results: Alcohol-related crashes were not related to bar density within local SA1 units, but were positively related to bar density in adjacent SA1 units. Alcohol-related crashes were negatively related to off-premise outlet density in local SA1 units. Conclusions: Examined in one metropolitan area using small spatial units, bar density is related to greater crash risk in surrounding areas. Observed negative relationships for off-premise outlets may be because the origins and destinations of alcohol-affected journeys are in distal locations relative to outlets.},

We characterize two- and three-district urban structures. For high population ratios or strong intergroup interactions, only a three-district city exists. In other cases, multiplicity of equilibria arises. Both groups generally rank these equilibria differently. However, when group sizes are similar, all individuals agree on which spatial equilibrium is best.},

  abstract = {Choropleth mapping provides a powerful way to visualize geographical phenomena with colors, shadings, or patterns. In many real-world applications, geographical data often contain uncertainty. How to incorporate such uncertainty into choropleth mapping is challenging. Although a few existing methods attempt to address the uncertainty issue in choropleth mapping, there are limitations to widely applying these methods due to their strong assumption on the distribution of uncertainty and the way in which similarity or dissimilarity is assessed. This article provides a new classification scheme for choropleth maps when data contain uncertainty. Considering that in a choropleth map, units in the same class are assigned with the same color or pattern, this new approach assumes the existence of a representative value for each class. A maximum likelihood estimation{\textendash}based approach is developed to determine class breaks so that the overall within-class deviation is minimized while considering uncertainty. Different methods{\textemdash}including linear programming, dynamic programming, and an interchange heuristic{\textemdash}are developed to solve the new classification problem. The proposed mapping approach has been applied to map the median household income data from the American Community Survey and simulated disease occurrence data. Test results show the effectiveness of the new approach. The linkage between the new approach and the existing methods is also discussed. Key Words: choropleth mapping, map classification, maximum likelihood estimation, uncertainty.},

In the Netherlands, telecommuting is rapidly becoming popular and is expected to affect residential locational preferences. A hypothesis that can be raised is that telecommuting has an impact on the effect that commute distance has on residential preferences. Based on this hypothesis, this paper investigates the role of telecommuting alongside the traditional factors currently explaining residential locational preferences. The paper provides evidence that, in the Netherlands, telecommuting has enabled people to commute longer distances. The effect of telecommuting on the probability of relocating, however, is not significant. Telecommuting appears to have a limited effect on residential location preferences, but traditional factors, such as life cycle stages, remain the dominant explanatory factors.},

There is a need to identify specific features of neighborhoods relevant to disease risk, but few measures of these features exist, and their measurement properties are understudied. In this paper, the authors 1) develop measures (scales) of neighborhood environment that are important in cardiovascular disease risk, 2) assess the psychometric and ecometric properties of these measures, and 3) examine individual- and neighborhood-level predictors of these measures. In 2004, data on neighborhood conditions were collected from a telephone survey of 5,988 residents at three US study sites (Baltimore, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and New York, New York). Information collected covered seven dimensions of neighborhood environment (aesthetic quality, walking environment, availability of healthy foods, safety, violence, social cohesion, and activities with neighbors). Neighborhoods were defined as census tracts or census clusters. Cronbach's alpha coefficient ranged from 0.73 to 0.83, with test-retest reliabilities of 0.60-0.88. Intraneighborhood correlations were 0.28-0.51, and neighborhood reliabilities were 0.64-0.78 for census tracts for most scales. The neighborhood scales were strongly associated with neighborhood SEP but also provided information distinct from neighborhood SEP. These results illustrate a methodological approach for assessing the measurement properties of neighborhood-level constructs and show that these constructs can be measured reliably.},

Current levels of both are estimated, for 10 year periods, using their lagged (own and cross) levels and eight other lagged variables. Population is affected by both human and natural amenities and employment by wages, patents, and other attributes of the workforce. This paper questions the conventional interpretation of the adjustment process by using geographically weighted regression (GWR) instead of standard linear (OLS, 2GLS) regression. Here the various estimates are all local, so the long-run equilibrium solutions for the adjustment process vary over space. Convergence no longer indicates a stable universal solution but instead involves a mix of stable and unstable local solutions. Local sustainability becomes an issue when making projections because employment can quickly lead or lag population in some metropolitan labor markets.},

Of the many proposed areal interpolation methods, few consider spatial autocorrelation, which is the general property of spatial data. In this paper, by employing a spatial process model, a new areal interpolation method that considers spatial autocorrelation is presented. First, we briefly survey previous areal interpolation techniques and demonstrate that the stochastic method is superior to the deterministic method in archiving accurate interpolations. Next, after a discussion on the spatial process model, a new areal interpolation method is suggested. In this method, both spatial autocorrelation and the volume preserving property, a property that should be considered in areal interpolation, are considered using a combination of a linear regression based areal interpolation method, and the spatial process model. Finally, a case study on the areal interpolation of a population is provided to demonstrate that the suggested method succeeds in improving the predictive accuracy. This case study indicates that the consideration of spatial autocorrelation is important for accurate areal interpolation.},

One particular example of the increased role of analytics is in the positioning of outfielders, who are tasked with tracking down balls hit to the outfield to record outs and minimize potential offensive damage. This paper explores the potential of location analytics to enhance the strategic positioning of players, enabling improved response and performance. We implement a location optimization model to analyze collegiate ball-tracking data, seeking outfielder locations that simultaneously minimize the average distance to a batted ball and maximize the weighted importance of batted ball coverage within a response standard. Trade-off outfielder configurations are compared to observed fielder positioning, finding that location models and spatial optimization can lead to performance improvements ranging from 1 to 3\%, offering a significant strategic advantage over the course of a season.},

Physical assumptions of the imaging system usually dictate that the matrices in these linear systems have exploitable structure. The specific structure depends on (usually simplifying) assumptions of the physical model and other considerations such as boundary conditions. When reflexive (Neumann) boundary conditions are used, the coefficient matrix is a combination of Toeplitz and Hankel matrices. Kronecker products also occur, but this structure is not obvious from measured data. In this paper we discuss a scheme for computing a (possibly approximate) Kronecker product decomposition of structured matrices in image processing, which extends previous work by Kamm and Nagy [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 22 (2000), pp. 155{\textendash}172] to a wider class of image restoration problems.},

In most of the US states, this process is made by non-independent actors and often causes debates about partisan manipulation. The somewhat ambiguous concept of compactness is a standard criterion for legislative districts. In the literature, circularity is widely used as a measure of compactness, since it is a natural requirement for a district to be as circular as possible. In this paper, we introduce a novel and parameter-free circularity measure that is based on Hu moment invariants. This new measure provides a powerful tool to detect districts with abnormal shapes. We examined some districts of Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, and Utah over several consecutive periods and redistricting plans, and also compared the results with classical circularity indexes. We found that the fall of the average circularity value of the new measure indicates potential gerrymandering.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Despite being one of the wealthiest nations, disparities in adverse birth outcomes persist across racial and ethnic lines in the United States. We studied the association between historical redlining and preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), small-for-gestational age (SGA), and perinatal mortality over a ten-year period (2006-2015) in Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco, California. METHODS:We used birth outcomes data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) Security Maps developed in the 1930s assigned neighborhoods one of four grades that pertained to perceived investment risk of borrowers from that neighborhood: green (grade A) were considered "Best", blue (grade B) "Still Desirable", yellow (grade C) "Definitely Declining", and red (grade D, hence the term "redlining") "Hazardous". Geocoded residential addresses at the time of birth were superimposed on HOLC Security Maps to assign each birth a HOLC grade. We adjusted for potential confounders present at the time of Security Map creation by assigning HOLC polygons areal-weighted 1940s Census measures. We then employed propensity score matching methods to estimate the association of historical HOLC grades on current birth outcomes. Because tracts graded A had almost no propensity of receiving grade C or D and because grade B tracts had low propensity of receiving grade D, we examined birth outcomes in the three following comparisons: B vs. A, C vs. B, and D vs. C. RESULTS:The prevalence of preterm birth, SGA and mortality tended to be higher in worse HOLC grades, while the prevalence of LBW varied across grades. Overall odds of mortality and preterm birth increased as HOLC grade worsened. Propensity score matching balanced 1940s census measures across contrasting groups. Logistic regression models revealed significantly elevated odds of preterm birth (odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.05), and SGA (OR: 1.03, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.05) in the C vs. B comparison and significantly reduced odds of preterm birth (OR: 0.93, 95\% CI: 0.91-0.95), LBW (OR: 0.94-95\% CI: 0.92-0.97), and SGA (OR: 0.94, 95\% CI: 0.92-0.96) in the D vs. C comparison. Results differed by metropolitan area and maternal race. CONCLUSION:Similar to prior studies on redlining, we found that worsening HOLC grade was associated with adverse birth outcomes, although this relationship was less clear after propensity score matching and stratifying by metropolitan area. Higher odds of preterm birth and SGA in grade C versus grade B neighborhoods may be caused by higher-stress environments, racial segregation, and lack of access to resources, while lower odds of preterm birth, SGA, and LBW in grade D versus grade C neighborhoods may due to population shifts in those neighborhoods related to gentrification.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Asthma disproportionately affects communities of colour in the USA, but the underlying factors for this remain poorly understood. In this study, we assess the role of historical redlining as outlined in security maps created by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), the discriminatory practice of categorising neighbourhoods on the basis of perceived mortgage investment risk, on the burden of asthma in these neighbourhoods. METHODS:We did an ecological study of HOLC risk grades and asthma exacerbations in California using the security maps available for the following eight cities: Fresno, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, and Stockton. Each census tract was categorised into one of four risk levels (A, B, C, or D) on the basis of the location of population-weighted centroids on security maps, with the worst risk level (D) indicating historical redlining. We obtained census tract-level rates of emergency department visits due to asthma from CalEnviroScreen 3.0. We assessed the relationship between risk grade and log-transformed asthma visit rates between 2011 and 2013 using ordinary least squares regression. We included potential confounding variables from the 2010 Census and CalEnviroScreen 3.0: diesel exhaust particle emissions, PM2{$\cdot$}5, and percent of the population living below 2 times the federal poverty level. We also built random intercept and slope models to assess city-level variation in the relationship between redlining and asthma. FINDINGS:In the 1431 census tracts assessed (64 [4{$\cdot$}5\%] grade A, 241 [16{$\cdot$}8\%] grade B, 719 [50{$\cdot$}2\%] grade C, and 407 [28{$\cdot$}4\%] grade D), the proportion of the population that was non-Hispanic black and Hispanic, the percentage of the population living in poverty, and diesel exhaust particle emissions all significantly increased as security map risk grade worsened (p\&lt;0{$\cdot$}0001). The median age-adjusted rates of emergency department visits due to asthma were 2{$\cdot$}4 times higher in census tracts that were previously redlined (median 63{$\cdot$}5 [IQR 34{$\cdot$}3] visits per 10 000 residents per year [2011-13]) than in tracts at the lowest risk level (26{$\cdot$}5 [18{$\cdot$}4]). In adjusted models, redlined census tracts were associated with a relative risk of 1{$\cdot$}39 (95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}21-1{$\cdot$}57) in rates of emergency department visits due to asthma compared with that of lowest-risk census tracts. INTERPRETATION:Historically redlined census tracts have significantly higher rates of emergency department visits due to asthma, suggesting that this discriminatory practice might be contributing to racial and ethnic asthma health disparities.

  abstract = {Temporal land use/land cover (LULC) change information provides a variety of applications for informed management of land resources. The aim of this study was to detect and predict LULC changes in the Arasbaran region using an integrated Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov Chain analysis. At the first step, multi-temporal Landsat images (1990, 2002 and 2014) were processed using ancillary data and were classified into seven LULC categories of high density forest, low-density forest, agriculture, grassland, barren land, water and urban area. Next, LULC changes were detected for three time profiles, 1990{\textendash}2002, 2002{\textendash}2014 and 1990{\textendash}2014. A 2014 LULC map of the study area was further simulated (for model performance evaluation) applying 1990 and 2002 map layers. In addition, a collection of spatial variables was also used for modeling LULC change processes as driving forces. The actual and simulated 2014 LULC change maps were cross-tabulated and compared to ensure model simulation success and the results indicated an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 97.79\% and 0.992, respectively. Having the model properly validated, LULC change was predicted up to the year 2025. The results demonstrated that 992 and 1592 ha of high and low-density forests were degraded during 1990{\textendash}2014, respectively, while 422 ha were added to the extent of residential areas with a growth rate of 17.58 ha per year. The developed model predicted a considerable degradation trend for the forest categories through 2025, accounting for 489 and 531 ha of loss for high and low-density forests, respectively. By way of contrast, residential area and farmland categories will increase up to 211 and 427 ha, respectively. The integrated prediction model and customary area data can be used for practical management efforts by simulating vegetation dynamics and future LULC change trajectories.},

Furthermore the chapter demonstrates that ICTs and GIS can prompt policymakers to apply much-needed changes of urban renewal, by helping those living in informal settlements to identify the slum assets that are essential to their livelihood and to ensure their own security. An inductive qualitative case study approach is used in the Kibera slums of Nairobi to develop theoretical explanations of the patterns that emerged. The findings show that, whereas slums have complex situations, increased transparency from open mapping can provide a platform for sustainable renewal.},

They are now used in many subfields of geography, and are among the most common ways to measure the world city network, where intercity links are inferred from firm co-location patterns. However, spatial bipartite projections are difficult to analyze because the links in these networks are weighted, and larger weights do not necessarily indicate stronger or more important connections. Methods for extracting the backbone of bipartite projections offer a solution by using statistical models for identifying the links that have statistically significant weights. In this paper, we introduce the open-source backbone R package, which implements several backbone models, and demonstrate its key features by using it to measure a world city network.},

A key challenge in analyzing such networks is determining whether an observed number of co-occurrences between two nodes is significant, and therefore whether an edge exists between them. One approach, the fixed degree sequence model (FDSM), evaluates the significance of an edge's weight by comparison to a null model in which the degree sequences of the original bipartite network are fixed. Although the FDSM is an intuitive null model, it is computationally expensive because it requires Monte Carlo simulation to estimate each edge's               p               value, and therefore is impractical for large projections. In this paper, we explore four potential alternatives to FDSM: fixed fill model, fixed row model, fixed column model, and stochastic degree sequence model (SDSM). We compare these models to FDSM in terms of accuracy, speed, statistical power, similarity, and ability to recover known communities. We find that the computationally-fast SDSM offers a statistically conservative but close approximation of the computationally-impractical FDSM under a wide range of conditions, and that it correctly recovers a known community structure even when the signal is weak. Therefore, although each backbone model may have particular applications, we recommend SDSM for extracting the backbone of bipartite projections when FDSM is impractical.},

  abstract = {We develop a spatial Poisson hurdle model to explore geographic variation in emergency department (ED) visits while accounting for zero inflation. The model consists of two components: a Bernoulli component that models the probability of any ED use (i.e. at least one ED visit per year), and a truncated Poisson component that models the number of ED visits given use. Together, these components address both the abundance of 0s and the right-skewed nature of the non-zero counts. The model has a hierarchical structure that incorporates patient and area level covariates, as well as spatially correlated random effects for each areal unit. Because regions with high rates of ED use are likely to have high expected counts among users, we model the spatial random effects via a bivariate conditionally auto-regressive prior, which introduces dependence between the components and provides spatial smoothing and sharing of information across neighbouring regions. Using a simulation study, we show that modelling the between-component correlation reduces bias in parameter estimates. We adopt a Bayesian estimation approach, and the model can be fitted by using standard Bayesian software. We apply the model to a study of patient and neighbourhood factors influencing ED use in Durham County, North Carolina.},

Urban containment is an attempt to regulate land uses in ways that reduce if not eliminate social exclusion. This paper uses information from a nation-wide survey of metropolitan planning organisations to identify metropolitan areas with urban containment programmes in place. A theory is developed and a model is applied to 242 metropolitan statistical areas to test the hypothesis that areas with urban containment witnessed greater reductions in residential segregation than those without. Preliminary statistical investigations show this to be the case. Policy implications and an outline for further research are provided.},

The model specification under the null allows for Markovian models, the transition mechanisms of which depend on an unknown vector of parameters and an unspecified distribution of i.i.d. innovations. Asymptotic properties of the test statistic are derived and the critical values of the test are found using appropriate bootstrap schemes. General properties of the bootstrap for Markovian processes are derived. A new central limit theorem for triangular arrays of weakly dependent random variables is obtained. For the proof of stochastic equicontinuity of multidimensional empirical processes, we use a simple approach based on an anisotropic tiling of the space. The finite-sample behavior of the proposed test is illustrated by some numerical examples and a real-data application is given.},

  abstract = {"One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results. Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way. In DEEP WORK, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four "rules," for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill. A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, DEEP WORK takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. DEEP WORK is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world"--},

Of particular interest is whether alcohol availability varies according to neighborhood racial/ethnic composition once measures of social disorganization (socioeconomic disadvantage, residential instability, and racial/ethnic heterogeneity) are controlled. Using data from the 1990 Census and 1993 alcohol license reports, we estimate a series of negative binomial regression models with corrections for spatial autocorrelation. The results show that percent Asian is associated with lower offsite alcohol outlet density. Once socioeconomic disadvantage is controlled, percent Latino is related to lower alcohol availability. Although similar suppressor patterns are observed, percent Black is generally unrelated to outlet density. Consistent with social disorganization theory, socioeconomic disadvantage and residential instability predict increased alcohol availability. Neighborhood racial/ethnic composition is either unrelated or inversely related to outlet density once social disorganization and other neighborhood characteristics are taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this introduction to a special issue of Applied Geography, we set out to articulate the importance of urban spatial context in broader present-day inequality debates. We argue that the information-based economy is emphatically urban-based and that it has forged new spatial inequalities in and between cities and among urban populations. Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas. We argue that attention to urban spatial dimensions at various scales is critical to understanding current inequality trends, from intra-urban to regional and global scales. Contributions to this special issue from North America, Europe, South America, and China suggest that deepening urban inequalities are pervasive across the globe.},

In a case study on the Charlotte, North Carolina metropolitan area between 2001 and 2020, we find a positive association between the marketing of sprawl characteristics mentioned in property listings of a neighborhood and an increasing share of minority applicants and a positive relationship between the marketing of smart growth characteristics, income, and higher-end housing amenities. The spatial and temporal patterns of the marketing of smart growth in real estate listings correspond to broader trends that have occurred across metropolitan areas in the past few decades with the increasing suburbanization of lower-income and minority residents, and an increasing preference for urban, walkable areas among residents of higher socioeconomic status.},

The diagnosis of the forces driving inequality upwards and their relative importance remain hotly contested, notably with respect to the roles of globalization versus technology and of market forces versus institutions and policy choices. This survey provides a critical review and synthesis of recent research. The focus is on income inequality across the entire distribution, rather than only on what has been happening at the very top. We pay particular attention to include what has been learned from the analysis of micro-data, to ensure that the coverage is not unduly US-centric and to analyses of the interrelations between the different drivers of inequality. The marked differences in inequality trends across countries and time periods reflect how global economic forces such as globalization and technological change have interacted with differing national contexts and institutions. Major analytical challenges stand in the way of a consensus emerging on the relative importance of different drivers in how income inequality has evolved in recent decades.},

  abstract = {Histopathological images are essential for the diagnosis of cancer type and selection of optimal treatment. However, the current clinical process of manual inspection of images is time consuming and prone to intra- and inter-observer variability. Here we show that key aspects of cancer image analysis can be performed by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across a wide spectrum of cancer types. In particular, we implement CNN architectures based on Google Inception v3 transfer learning to analyze 27815 H\&amp;E slides from 23 cohorts in The Cancer Genome Atlas in studies of tumor/normal status, cancer subtype, and mutation status. For 19 solid cancer types we are able to classify tumor/normal status of whole slide images with extremely high AUCs (0.9950.008). We are also able to classify cancer subtypes within 10 tissue types with AUC values well above random expectations (micro-average 0.870.1). We then perform a cross-classification analysis of tumor/normal status across tumor types. We find that classifiers trained on one type are often effective in distinguishing tumor from normal in other cancer types, with the relationships among classifiers matching known cancer tissue relationships. For the more challenging problem of mutational status, we are able to classify TP53 mutations in three cancer types with AUCs from 0.65-0.80 using a fully-trained CNN, and with similar cross-classification accuracy across tissues. These studies demonstrate the power of CNNs for not only classifying histopathological images in diverse cancer types, but also for revealing shared biology between tumors.

  abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes{\textemdash}a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

  abstract = {Reproducible research is often perceived as a technological challenge, but it is rooted in the challenge to improve scholarly communication in an age of digitization. When computers become involved and researchers want to allow other scientists to inspect, understand, evaluate, and build on their work, they need to create a research compendium that includes the code, data, computing environment, and script-based workflows used. Here, we present the state of the art for approaches to reach this degree of computational reproducibility, addressing literate programming and containerization while paying attention to working with geospatial data (digital maps, geographic information systems). We argue that all researchers working with computers should understand these technologies to control their computing environment, and we present the benefits of reproducible workflows in practice. Example research compendia illustrate the presented concepts and are the basis for challenges specific to geography and geosciences. Based on existing surveys and best practices from different scientific domains, we conclude that researchers today can overcome many barriers and achieve a very high degree of reproducibility. If the geography and geosciences communities adopt reproducibility and the underlying technologies in practice and in policies, they can transform the way researchers conduct and communicate their work toward increased transparency, understandability, openness, trust, productivity, and innovation.},

  abstract = {Fractures rarely occur individually but more usually as networks of numerous fractures whose arrangement, abundance, and interaction control the mechanical and transport properties of rock masses. Of particular importance are the distributions and spatial variations of different geometric (locations, orientation, length, etc.) and topological (intersections, connectivity, etc.) \-attributes of fractures in a network. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) provide a means to map and digitize two-dimensional fracture networks from a variety of field and remote sensing data and to display the results in the form of quality maps. We introduce NetworkGT, an open-source toolbox for ArcGIS capable of efficient sampling, analysis, and spatial mapping of geometric and topological attributes of two-dimensional fracture networks. The toolbox helps to extract and plot geometric and topological information from a given two-dimensional fracture network including: rose diagrams, plots of frequency distribution and topology, and maps of topological parameters. Using a fracture network example from offshore NW Devon, United Kingdom, we illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the toolbox. This includes computing a contour grid with 1326 subsampled regions within the fracture network, which is used to demonstrate the quantitative capabilities of the toolbox and the ability to spatially map important network properties. The toolbox will help to facilitate the increasing application of geometry and topology in the analysis and comparison of fracture networks at a range of scales. Furthermore, the integration of the NetworkGT toolbox into ArcGIS allows two-dimensional fracture networks to be interpreted, mapped, and fully analyzed within the same software package.},

The decomposition satisfies the completely identical distribution (CID) condition, whereby the between-group inequality is null if and only if the distribution within each subgroup is identical to all the others. Thus, this decomposition contrasts strikingly with the subgroup decomposition of the generalized entropy measures, which satisfy the condition that the between-group inequality is null if the mean within each subgroup equals those of all the others. The new decomposition can be generalized to the distance-Gini index and the volume-Gini index, two multivariate Gini indices introduced by Koshevoy and Mosler, with some modification of the index definition and a somewhat loosened CID condition in the latter case. The source decomposition is also generalized to these multi-dimensional indices. Interaction terms appear among sources of different attributes in the decomposition for the modified volume{\textendash}Gini index.},

Simulation results show that several phases (the short transient, the complete asynchronous, the long transient and the intermediate transient) appear one after another as Z increases. In the long transient phase, the intermittent clustering process with a long chaotic transient appears repeatedly.},

  abstract = {Researchers have questioned whether the ability to telecommute is encouraging workers to relocate to more desirable residences farther from work, and in doing so, exacerbate sprawl and increase their net vehicle-miles traveled. The research presented here directly asks, is telecommuting a 'friend or foe' of travel-reducing policies? Given that telecommuters tend to have longer commutes than non-telecommuters, is the ability to telecommute prompting workers to move farther away from work? Or rather, does the ability to telecommute allow those who for other reasons have already chosen, or would in any case choose, to live in more distant locations to commute less frequently? These questions are addressed using data collected from more than 200 State of California workers, including current, former, and non-telecommuters. The survey inquired retrospectively about their residential relocations, as well as their telecommuting engagements, over a 10-year period. The results indicate that, as expected, residential moves that are temporally associated with telecommuting episodes tend to increase commute time and length compared to other moves{$\dottedsquare$}although the differences are not statistically significant. Analyzing the temporal order of telecommuting engagement and residential relocation, the data show that those who are telecommuting and then move actually tend to relocate \emph{closer} to their workplace, whereas those who begin telecommuting following a residential relocation tended to have moved much farther from their workplace. Analysis of the stated importance of telecommuting to specific residential relocations did not show a convincing effect toward more distant moves. Thus, the evidence more strongly supports the positive view of telecommuting, that it is ameliorating the negative transportation impacts of moves that occur for other reasons.},

The results demonstrate that this estimator accounts for missing spatial information, producing more reliable results on estimated spatially related coefficients. The CAR model is benchmarked against a fixed effects model. Socioeconomic neighborhood characteristics are found to have only modest impact on spatial variation in housing prices.},

  abstract = {This article describes two spatially explicit models created to allow experimentation with different societal responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We outline the work to date on modeling spatially explicit infective diseases and show that there are gaps that remain important to fill. We demonstrate how geographical regions, rather than a single, national approach, are likely to lead to better outcomes for the population. We provide a full account of how our models function, and how they can be used to explore many different aspects of contagion, including: experimenting with different lockdown measures, with connectivity between places, with the tracing of disease clusters, and the use of improved contact tracing and isolation. We provide comprehensive results showing the use of these models in given scenarios, and conclude that explicitly regionalized models for mitigation provide significant advantages over a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach. We have made our models, and their data, publicly available for others to use in their own locales, with the hope of providing the tools needed for geographers to have a voice during this difficult time.},

  abstract = {Study of gene-environment interaction is important for improving accuracy and precision in the assessment of both genetic and environmental influences. This overview presents a simple definition of gene-environment interaction and suggests study designs for detecting it. Gene-environment interaction is defined as "a different effect of an environmental exposure on disease risk in persons with different genotypes," or, alternatively, "a different effect of a genotype on disease risk in persons with different environmental exposures." Under this strictly statistical definition, the presence or absence of interaction depends upon the scale of measurement (additive or multiplicative). The decision of which scale is appropriate will be governed by many factors, including the main objective of an investigation (discovery of etiology, public health prediction, etc.) and the hypothesized pathophysiologic model. Five biologically plausible models are described for the relations between genotypes and environmental exposures, in terms of their effects on disease risk. Each of these models leads to a different set of predictions about disease risk in individuals classified by presence or absence of a high-risk genotype and environmental exposure. Classification according to the exposure is relatively easy, using conventional epidemiologic methods. Classification according to the high-risk genotype is more difficult, but several alternative strategies are suggested.},

  abstract = {Scholars hypothesize that both neighborhood and school contexts influence educational attainment, but few have considered both contexts simultaneously. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the author analyzes how school and neighborhood contexts are jointly related to high school and college graduation. She finds that the absolute level of neighborhood resources positively predicts earning a bachelor's degree, while relative neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) compared to school peers' neighborhood SES predicts high school graduation. Interactions between school and neighborhood characteristics reveal that low odds of educational attainment among students from lower-SES neighborhoods are reduced even more when a student attends school with more white and high-SES peers. Conversely, the high odds of educational attainment among students from higher-SES neighborhoods are further enhanced by attending school with more white and high-SES peers. Findings suggest that neighborhood SES may be a basis for relative deprivation within schools. Policy makers need to determine how students from different neighborhoods are integrated into a school's structure and culture in order for policies that mix students from different neighborhood backgrounds to succeed. Attending a high-SES, largely white school does not eliminate (and may even exacerbate) the disadvantages of coming from a low-SES neighborhood.},

Past research on neighborhood upgrading tends to focus on one process: gentrification. I argue that a broader range of types of neighborhood socioeconomic ascent requires examination. This article documents the different types of neighborhoods ascending from 1970 to the present. Using principal components analysis and cluster analysis, I report the prevalence of socioeconomic ascent, based on increases in neighborhood income, rents, house values, and educational and occupational attainment, among five to seven types of neighborhoods in each decade. I also examine population and housing changes that co-occur with ascent to identify processes of ascent beyond gentrification. Overall, findings suggest mixed implications for neighborhood inequality. While white suburban neighborhoods make up the bulk of neighborhoods that ascend in each decade, minority and immigrant neighborhoods become increasingly likely to ascend over time, though displacement may occur.},

Within large districts, between-school segregation of students who are eligible and ineligible for free lunch increased by over 40\% from 1991 to 2012. Consistent with research on neighborhood segregation, we find that rising income inequality contributed to the rise in income segregation between schools and districts during this period.

I document racial segregation between neighborhoods among school-age children and adults in 2000 and 2010 and find that though the racial composition of children's and adults' neighborhoods is similar, exposure to own-age neighbors varies. Compared with adults' exposure to other adults, children are exposed to fewer white and more minority, particularly Hispanic, children. This is due in part to compositional differences, but children are also more unevenly sorted across neighborhoods by race than adults. One explanation for higher segregation among children is that parents consider school options when making residential choices. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that school district boundaries account for a larger proportion of neighborhood segregation among children than among adults. Future research on spatial inequality must consider the multiple contexts differentially contributing to inequality among children and adults.},

This article explores one explanation for such gaps: income segregation between school districts, which creates inequality in the economic and social resources available in advantaged and disadvantaged students' school contexts. Drawing on national data, I find that the income achievement gap is larger in highly segregated metropolitan areas. This is due mainly to high-income students performing better, rather than low-income children performing worse, in more-segregated places. Income segregation between districts also contributes to the racial achievement gap, largely because white students perform better in more economically segregated places. Descriptive portraits of the school districts of high- and low-income students show that income segregation creates affluent districts for high-income students while changing the contexts of low-income students negligibly. Considering income and race jointly, I find that only high-income white families live in the affluent districts created by income segregation; black families with identically high incomes live in districts more similar to those of low-income white families. My results demonstrate that the spatial inequalities created by income segregation between school districts contribute to achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students, with implications for future research and policy.},

Drawing on Census and American Community Survey data from 1990 to 2010, we first explore whether changes in racial/ethnic composition occur alongside ascent. We find that, while most neighborhoods' racial/ethnic composition does not dramatically change during this period, neighborhoods that experienced ascent are much more likely to transition from majority-minority to mixed race or predominantly White than nonascending neighborhoods. Then, we use microdata to analyze whether two potential drivers of ascent, the in-migration of higher-socioeconomic status (SES) households and changes in the fortunes of long-term residents, are racially/ethnically stratified. We argue that the process of neighborhood socioeconomic ascent perpetuates neighborhood racial/ethnic hierarchy. While most Black and Hispanic neighborhoods remain majority-minority, those that ascend are more likely to experience a succession of high-SES White residents replacing minority residents.},

Over the past 25~years, racial segregation in neighborhoods and schools has slightly declined in terms of sorting, though children remain racially isolated in their neighborhoods and schools. Income segregation between schools, school districts, and neighborhoods has increased among children. Recent educational policy and demographic changes may break the link between neighborhood and school segregation. As population diversity increases, the proliferation of school choice leads schools and neighborhoods to resemble one another less, with schools becoming more segregated than their local neighborhoods. Regardless of the complicated and changing ways neighborhood and school segregation shape and reshape one another, segregation in both contexts remains high in the twenty-first century. Drawing on administrative data, I provide a quantitative portrait of the schools and neighborhoods of children from different racial/ethnic groups in 2015, documenting stark inequalities in these contexts.

In this article, we use geospatial techniques to combine five administrative data sets to examine the characteristics of local public schools serving high- and low-income neighbourhoods in US metropolitan areas in 2013{\textendash}2014. We find that high-income neighbourhoods are served by schools with greater social, financial, and instructional resources and greater student achievement than schools serving low-income neighbourhoods. Moreover, when metropolitan neighbourhoods are highly segregated by income, these inequalities are exacerbated. Our results demonstrate the link between neighbourhood and school disadvantage, with implications for policymakers concerned about social mobility and inequality.},

We find three such common factors, each of which is associated with a set of factor loadings that indicate the extent to which each state's economy is related to the national business cycle. According to the factor loadings, there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the nature of the links between state and national economies. In addition to exhibiting geographic patterns, the closeness of state economies to the national business cycle is related not only to differences in industry mix but also to non-industry variables such as agglomeration and neighbor effects. Finally, we find that the common factors tend to explain large proportions of the total variability in state-level business cycles, although, again, there is a great deal of cross-state heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {In epidemiological research, outcomes are frequently non-normal, sample sizes may be large, and effect sizes are often small. To relate health outcomes to geographic risk factors, fast and powerful methods for fitting spatial models, particularly for non-normal data, are required. I focus on binary outcomes, with the risk surface a smooth function of space, but the development herein is relevant for non-normal data in general. I compare penalized likelihood models, including the penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) approach, and Bayesian models based on fit, speed, and ease of implementation., A Bayesian model using a spectral basis representation of the spatial surface via the Fourier basis provides the best tradeoff of sensitivity and specificity in simulations, detecting real spatial features while limiting overfitting and being reasonably computationally efficient. One of the contributions of this work is further development of this underused representation. The spectral basis model outperforms the penalized likelihood methods, which are prone to overfitting, but is slower to fit and not as easily implemented. A Bayesian Markov random field model performs less well statistically than the spectral basis model, but is very computationally efficient. We illustrate the methods on a real dataset of cancer cases in Taiwan., The success of the spectral basis with binary data and similar results with count data suggest that it may be generally useful in spatial models and more complicated hierarchical models.},

  abstract = {Traditional inequality measures fail to capture the geographical distribution of income. The failure to consider such distribution implies that, holding income constant, different spatial patterns provide the same inequality measure. This property is referred to as anonymity and presents an interesting question about the relationship between inequality and space. Particularly, spatial dependence could play an important role in shaping the geographical distribution of income and could be usefully incorporated into inequality measures. Following this idea, this paper introduces a new measure that facilitates the assessment of the relative contribution of spatial patterns to overall inequality. The proposed index is based on the Gini correlation measure and accounts for both inequality and spatial autocorrelation. Unlike most of the spatially based income inequality measures proposed in the literature, our index introduces regional importance weighting in the analysis, thereby differentiating the regional contributions to overall inequality. Starting with the proposed measure, a spatial decomposition of the Gini index of inequality for weighted data is also derived. This decomposition permits the identification of the actual extent of regional disparities and the understanding of the interdependences among regional economies. The proposed measure is illustrated by an empirical analysis focused on Italian provinces.},

Therefore, segregation has become an increasing concern and topic of research with studies typically concentrating on the residential communities of a particular racial or socioeconomic group. This paper enhances the residential view of segregation and examines the topic in the context of urban mobility. Specifically, it expands upon prior research by employing large-sample, seamless telecommunication logs of London, UK to provide a holistic view of mobility across the entire socioeconomic spectrum. A method is developed to transform the data to flows between geographic areas with different socioeconomic statuses. Spatial interaction models are then calibrated to examine the impact of both geographical distance and socioeconomic distance on the deterrence of flows and the analysis is extended to analyze the interaction of the two factors. Overall, socioeconomic distance is found to have a subtle effect compared to geographical distance. However, different effects are observed depending on the socioeconomic distance between flows and the deterrence of mobility tends to be the greatest when both physical and socioeconomic distance are high, suggesting that both factors may play a role creating and maintaining segregation.},

Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge, thereby creating conditions that should be ripe for major advances8,9. Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields10,11. Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six decades, using data on 45\,million papers and 3.9\,million patents from six large-scale datasets, together with a new quantitative metric{\textemdash}the CD index12{\textemdash}that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics1,13{\textendash}17. Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the `shoulders of giants' view. We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science, citation practices or field-specific factors. Overall, our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may reflect a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology.},

Mixed findings are not unexpected if there are differing short- and long-term responses. Approaches utilizing cross-sectional variation primarily reflect long-run effects, whereas those using time-series variation primarily reveal short-run effects. This study reconciles these issues using U.S. state data. After allowing for short- and long-run responses and for separate effects between the tails and middle of the distribution, the consistent pattern is the middle-class share and overall inequality are positively related to long-run growth. However, the short-run income-distribution response is less clear.},

His work explains how we can know easy things, like whether it was rain or a sprinkler that made a sidewalk wet; and how to answer hard questions, like whether a drug cured an illness. Pearl's work enables us to know not just whether one thing causes another: it lets us explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been.

Results indicate that preK had no measurable impact on children's third-grade math achievement regardless of children's neighborhood conditions. However, preK significantly improved third-grade reading achievement for children living in high-poverty neighborhoods. The treatment effects on reading achievement were substantial: Among children living in high-poverty neighborhoods, those who took up an experimental assignment to attend preK scored over half a standard deviation higher on average than the control group in third grade. In contrast, preK enrollment had, if anything, a negative effect on third-grade reading achievement among children living in low-poverty neighborhoods. These differential effects were partially explained by alternative childcare options and contextual risk factors.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, an increasing number of government agencies have developed urban data strategies and contributed to Open Data ecosystems. These initiatives, which look at supporting efficiencies and collaboration in city shaping, are crucial in realising the vision of sustainable, productive, and resilient cities. However, maintaining access to high quality, consistent, updated, and replicable urban data remains a challenge. The current urban data landscape is characterised by avoidable duplications, large data gaps, and spatial or temporal mismatches. Moreover, many data assets remain siloed within and between organisations so their value is far from being fully realised. A recent study undertaken with Landcom NSW{\textemdash}a state-owned agency in charge of managing large urban transformation programmes in New South Wales (NSW, Australia){\textemdash}aimed at developing a roadmap towards an urban knowledge-sharing platform called the Connected City Data Hub. Interviews with key stakeholders confirmed the need for a robust information management strategy in order to support the creation of a purposeful and useful platform. Drawing from several sources, the authors propose an information management framework that is then used to review several international city data stores or hubs.},

It has been shown that, given a centrally symmetric point spread function (PSF), this boundary condition gives rise to a structured blurring matrix, a submatrix of which can be diagonalized by the discrete sine transform (DST), leading to an O(n2 log n) solution algorithm for an image of size n {\texttimes} n. In this paper, we obtain a Kronecker product approximation of the general structured blurring matrix that arises under this boundary condition, regardless of symmetry properties of the PSF. We then demonstrate the usefulness and efficiency of our approximation in an SVD-based restoration algorithm, the computational cost of which would otherwise be prohibitive.

We review theoretical and empirical approaches to place and space from diverse disciplines, and explore the geographical scopes of neighbourhood effects mechanisms. Ultimately, we suggest how microgeographic data can be used to operationalise sociospatial context, where data pragmatism should be supplanted by a theory-driven data exploration.},

Such screen maps are frequently created in the course of the interactive navigation in a geographic information system. Since screen maps have to support the functions zooming and scrolling, the label placement must be achieved very fast. Therefore we developed a concept which separates the labeling process into two phases. Calculations are shifted in a socalled preprocessing-phase as far as possible. Thus, the number of time consuming operations in the time critical interaction-phase is reduced and the operation zooming and scrolling can be realized very fast. Our concept supports labeling of point objects as well as labeling of line and area objects.},

  abstract = {Maps of morbidity or mortality rates, whether considered individually or as a layer in a geographic information system application, invite multiple comparisons of area rates. However, comparisons of rates across different populations require standardization of the age-specific rates to account for differences in population age structures. The indirect standardization method, or equivalently the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), has been recommended for small areas where age-specific rates can be quite variable. Although theoretically equivalent to directly adjusted rates under the assumption of independent age and area effects, indirect summary measures are not comparable across areas when this assumption is violated. We tested the validity of this assumption for the 10 most common causes of death in the United States during 1980{\textendash}84 and examined the geographic clustering apparent when categorized death rates, adjusted by different methods, are presented as thematic maps. Although overall agreement between the methods was good (rank correlation coefficient {$>$}82 per cent for each cause), when the adjusted rates were classified into quintiles 18 per cent of the states fell into different categories depending on the method of adjustment. Using an internal standard for the indirect method reduced this discrepancy to 4{$\cdot$}9 per cent. However, both traditional chi-square tests and a generalized logistic spline model identified significant interactions between age and area for each cause of death, a violation of the assumption required for equivalence of the methods. Potential variation in geographic inferences is illustrated by maps of direct and indirect rates and an empirical Bayes posterior mean, which is a function of these traditionally adjusted rates. Based on these results, we recommend the direct age-adjustment method for rate maps.},

In turn, insights regarding urban activity patterns have been used to motivate alternative residential neighbourhood measurement strategies incorporating dimensions of activity space in the form of egocentric neighbourhoods {\textendash} measurement approaches that place individuals at the centre of their own residential neighbourhood units. Unexamined, however, is the extent to which the boundaries of residents' own self-defined residential neighbourhoods compare with census-based and egocentric neighbourhood measurement approaches in aligning with residents' routine activity locations. We first assess this question, examining whether the boundaries of residents' self-defined residential neighbourhoods are in closer proximity to the coordinates of a range of activity location types than are the boundaries of their census and egocentric residential neighbourhood measurement approaches. We find little evidence that egocentric or, crucially, self-defined residential neighbourhoods better align with activity locations, suggesting a division in residents' activity locations and conceptions of their residential neighbourhoods. We then examine opposing hypotheses about how self-defined residential neighbourhoods and census tracts compare in socioeconomic and racial composition. Overall, our findings suggest that residents bound less segregated neighbourhoods than those produced by census geography, but self-defined residential neighbourhoods still reflect a preference towards homophily when considering areas beyond the immediate environment of their residence. These findings underscore the significance of individuals' conceptions of residential neighbourhoods to understanding and measuring urban social processes such as residential segregation and social disorganisation.},

  abstract = {Background. Attribution to the original contributor upon reuse of published data is important both as a reward for data creators and to document the provenance of research findings. Previous studies have found that papers with publicly available datasets receive a higher number of citations than similar studies without available data. However, few previous analyses have had the statistical power to control for the many variables known to predict citation rate, which has led to uncertain estimates of the ``citation benefit''. Furthermore, little is known about patterns in data reuse over time and across datasets. Method and Results. Here, we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors and investigate the variability of data reuse. In a multivariate regression on 10,555 studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies that made data available in a public repository received 9\% (95\% confidence interval: 5\% to 13\%) more citations than similar studies for which the data was not made available. Date of publication, journal impact factor, open access status, number of authors, first and last author publication history, corresponding author country, institution citation history, and study topic were included as covariates. The citation benefit varied with date of dataset deposition: a citation benefit was most clear for papers published in 2004 and 2005, at about 30\%. Authors published most papers using their own datasets within two years of their first publication on the dataset, whereas data reuse papers published by third-party investigators continued to accumulate for at least six years. To study patterns of data reuse directly, we compiled 9,724 instances of third party data reuse via mention of GEO or ArrayExpress accession numbers in the full text of papers. The level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimated that 40 papers in PubMed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 data reuse papers had been published by year 5. Data reuse was distributed across a broad base of datasets: a very conservative estimate found that 20\% of the datasets deposited between 2003 and 2007 had been reused at least once by third parties. Conclusion. After accounting for other factors affecting citation rate, we find a robust citation benefit from open data, although a smaller one than previously reported. We conclude there is a direct effect of third-party data reuse that persists for years beyond the time when researchers have published most of the papers reusing their own data. Other factors that may also contribute to the citation benefit are considered. We further conclude that, at least for gene expression microarray data, a substantial fraction of archived datasets are reused, and that the intensity of dataset reuse has been steadily increasing since 2003.},

We perform this study from an evolutionary game theoretic perspective using two Replicator Dynamics models. First we consider the basic selection model on this data, secondly we use a model which includes both selection and mutation. We investigate the dynamic properties by studying how rational players switch between different strategies under different circumstances, what the basins of attraction of the equilibria look like, and what the stability properties of the attractors are. We illustrate the dynamics using a simplex analysis. Our experimental results confirm existing domain knowledge of the game, namely that certain strategies are clearly inferior while others can be successful given certain game conditions.},

This paper examines the cross-tabulation matrix to assess the total change of land categories according to two pairs of components: net change and swap, as well as gross gains and gross losses. Analysis of these components can distinguish between a clearly systematic landscape transition and a seemingly random landscape transition. Multiple resolution analysis provides additional information concerning the distances over which land change occurs. An example of change among four land categories in central Massachusetts illustrates the methods. These methods enable scientists to focus on the strongest signals of systematic landscape transitions, which is necessary ultimately to link pattern to process.},

In this way, both the development of ``smart'' technology itself and its criticisms are the latest chapter in a long-standing disciplinary debate around quantification and technology. We reevaluate this history and argue that quantitative methodology and its theoretical critiques are not as incompatible as often claimed. To illustrate how we might address this apparent tension between theory and quantitative methods, we review how both approaches conceptualize one of geography's core concepts{\textemdash}space{\textemdash}and highlight opportunities for symbiosis. Although smart technologies can further orthodox positivist approaches, we argue that the actual practice is more nuanced and not necessarily absolute or totalizing. For example, recent computational work builds on critical geographic theories to analyze and visualize topological and relational spaces, relevant to topics such as gentrification and segregation. The result is not a geography in which smart technology and algorithms remove the need for human input but rather a rejoinder in line with the recent resurgence of a critical quantitative geography. In short, the result is a geography where social theory and the human intellect play a key role in guiding computational approaches to analyze the largest, most versatile, most and relevant data sets on social space that we have ever had.

Many smart cities are embracing these technologies to foster an Open Data culture through the provision of city datastores. We, in this chapter, examine the Open Data policies and platforms in India to reveal the status, challenges and opportunities of building and sustaining city data architectures. A careful selection of case studies of city datastores informs the evolution of the sites, the availability of data across urban sectors and the limitation and breakthroughs of the projects. We find that the city Open Data platforms are more likely to sustain if developed and operated at a regional level, rather than at the national level{\textemdash}where past initiatives have shown limited success. The chapter benchmarks the Indian city datastores with global case studies for identifying a series of recommendations and inspirations. We propose that the leading Indian cities must significantly expand capabilities for capturing real-time information and bring them together through open city dashboards to support informed policymaking. We provide a direction for public authorities in India and across the global south to leverage Open Data for shaping smart cities.},

  abstract = {Geographic proximity is a determinant factor of friendship. Friendship datasets that include detailed geographic information are scarce, and when this information is available, the dependence of friendship on distance is often modelled by pre-specified parametric functions or derived from theory without further empirical assessment. This paper aims to give a detailed representation of the association between distance and the likelihood of friendship existence and friendship dynamics, and how this is modified by a few basic social and individual factors. The data employed is a three-wave network of 336 adolescents living in a small Swedish town, for whom information has been collected on their household locations. The analysis is a three-step process that combines (1) nonparametric logistic regressions to unravel the overall functional form of the dependence of friendship on distance, without assuming it has a particular strength or shape; (2) parametric logistic regressions to construct suitable transformations of distance that can be employed in (3) stochastic models for longitudinal network data, to assess how distance, individual covariates, and network structure shape adolescent friendship dynamics. It was found that the log-odds of friendship existence and friendship dynamics decrease smoothly with the logarithm of distance. For adolescents in different schools the dependence is linear, and stronger than for adolescents in the same school. Living nearby accounts, in this dataset, for an aspect of friendship dynamics that is not explicitly modelled by network structure or by individual covariates. In particular, the estimated distance effect is not correlated with reciprocity or transitivity effects.},

Based on the theoretical and empirical literatures on social organization and crime, we tested the hypothesis that the association between alcohol outlet density and neighbourhood violence rates is moderated by social organization. Using geocoded police data on assaults, geocoded data on the location of alcohol outlets, and controlling for several structural factors thought to be associated with violence rates, we tested this hypothesis employing negative binomial regression with our sample of 298 block groups in Cincinnati. Our results revealed direct effects of alcohol outlet density and social organization on assault density, and these effects held for different outlet types (i.e., off-premise, bars, restaurants) and levels of harm (i.e., simple and aggravated assaults). More importantly, we found that the strength of the outlet-assault association was significantly weaker in more socially organized communities. Subsequent analyses by level of organization revealed no effects of alcohol outlet density on aggravated assaults in organized block groups, but significant effects in disorganized block groups. We found no association between social (dis)organization and outlet density. These results clarify the community-level relationship between alcohol outlets and violence and have important implications for municipal-level alcohol policies. {\textcopyright} London School of Economics and Political Science 2012.}

This study tested the moderating influence of land use on the outlet-violence association. Design. Cross-sectional ecological study that controlled for spatial autocorrelation. Setting, Participants and Measurements. Police-recorded data on simple and aggravated assaults were obtained for all 302 block groups (mean population=1038) in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Addresses of alcohol outlets for Cincinnati were obtained from the Ohio Division of Liquor Control, geocoded to the street level, and aggregated to census block groups. Data on eight categories of land use were obtained from the Cincinnati Area Geographic Information System, with location quotients computed for each block group. Findings. We found substantial evidence that the impact of total alcohol outlet density, bar density and carryout density on assault density was moderated by land use. Conclusions. By taking into account local characteristics, policy-makers can make more informed decisions when regulating the placement and density of alcohol licenses in urban areas. Similarly, more systematic knowledge of how the association between alcohol outlet density and assault varies across the urban landscape should reduce harm and promote responsible retailing. Nevertheless, ours is one of the first studies to address the moderating effect of land use and we encourage further research to test the stability and generalisability of our results. {\textcopyright} 2011 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.}

The authors estimated separate models for off-premise outlets, bars, and restaurants. The results revealed a positive and significant association between outlet density and assault density. This association held for simple and aggravated assaults and for total outlet density and the density of each type of outlet. Further tests showed the outlet-violence association to be stronger for off-premise outlets relative to bars and restaurants and for simple relative to aggravated assaults. Estimation of attributable fractions (AFs) showed that off-premise outlets may account for approximately one-quarter and one-third of simple and aggravated assaults, respectively. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.}

  abstract = {Background: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) is prevalent in the United States. Each year between 180,000 and 400,000 people die due to cardiac arrest. The automated external defibrillator (AED) has greatly enhanced survival rates for OOHCA. However, one of the important components of successful cardiac arrest treatment is emergency medical services (EMS) response time (i.e., the time from EMS ``wheels rolling'' until arrival at the OOHCA scene). Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have regularly been used for remote sensing and aerial imagery collection, but there are new opportunities to use drones for medical emergencies. Objective: The purpose of this study is to develop a geographic approach to the placement of a network of medical drones, equipped with an automated external defibrillator, designed to minimize travel time to victims of outof-hospital cardiac arrest. Our goal was to have one drone on scene within one minute for at least 90\% of demand for AED shock therapy, while minimizing implementation costs. Methods: In our study, the current estimated travel times were evaluated in Salt Lake County using geographical information systems (GIS) and compared to the estimated travel times of a network of AED enabled medical drones. We employed a location model, the Maximum Coverage Location Problem (MCLP), to determine the best configuration of drones to increase service coverage within one minute. Results: We found that, using traditional vehicles, only 4.3\% of the demand can be reached (travel time) within one minute utilizing current EMS agency locations, while 96.4\% of demand can be reached within five minutes using current EMS vehicles and facility locations. Analyses show that using existing EMS stations to launch drones resulted in 80.1\% of cardiac arrest demand being reached within one minute Allowing new sites to launch drones resulted in 90.3\% of demand being reached within one minute. Finally, using existing EMS and new sites resulted in 90.3\% of demand being reached while greatly reducing estimated overall costs.

  abstract = {A road network can be represented as a weighted directed graph with the nodes being the traffic intersections, the edges being the road segments, and the weights being some attribute of a road segment. Such a representation enables researchers to analyze road networks in consistent and automatable ways from the perspectives of graph theory. For example, analysis of the graph along with the traffic demand pattern can identify critical road segments based on centrality measures. However, due to the complexity of real-world road networks and the computationally expensive algorithms, it is challenging to extend the such methods to a large-scale road network. In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient network simplification framework based on graph theory that sub-samples and simplifies the graph while preserving key topological characteristics in the original network. Our method iteratively identifies and removes network elements that do not contribute to transportation functionality, such as self-loops, dead-ends, and interstitial nodes that lies on the same road line. We applied this method to three small cities with distinct street patterns and one large city, and showed that topological characteristics in the original networks are preserved by comparing two distinct kinds of centrality distributions in the original and simplified networks.},

  abstract = {Misuse of alcohol is a significant public health problem, potentially resulting in unintentional injuries, motor vehicle crashes, drownings, and, perhaps of greatest concern, serious acts of violence, including assaults, rapes, suicides, and homicides. Although previous research establishes a link between alcohol consumption increased levels of violence, studies relating the density of alcohol outlets (e.g., restaurants, bars, liquor stores) and the likelihood of violent crime have been less common. In this paper we test for such a relationship at the small area level, using data from 79 neighborhoods in the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. We adopt a fully Bayesian point of view using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computational methods as available in the popular and freely available WinBUGS language. Our models control for important covariates (e.g., neighborhood racial heterogeneity, age heterogeneity) and also account for spatial association in unexplained variability using conditionally autoregressive (CAR) random effects. Our results indicate a significant positive relationship between alcohol outlet density and violent crime, while also permitting easy mapping of neighborhood-level predicted and residual values, the former useful for intervention in the most at-risk neighborhoods and the latter potentially useful in identifying covariates still missing from the fixed effects portion of the model.},

Presenting a case study of online engagement with the development of ``parklets'', this chapter illustrates how social media data analytics can be utilised to better understand the dynamics of open and complex collaboration in the context of urban planning and governance. These insights offer enabling strategies for city officials to become involved in and contribute to civic conversations and actions of individual citizens and local communities.},

Based on our research on neighbourhood change in Atlantic Canadian cities, we have developed two ``simple'' indexes of neighbourhood change. We document the steps to creating the simple indexes and discuss what decisions are made along the way. We then compare results of the two indexes with a mean-centred index that is commonly used for academic audiences. This is done to assess how simpler methods perform compared to one that is considered more sophisticated. Using the 2006 and 2016 Canadian Census data, we apply each of these neighbourhood change indexes to four Atlantic Canadian cities. Results indicate some similarities between the simple indexes and the mean-centred index. We discuss the methodological and practical implications of the results to help facilitate knowledge translation of academic research for urban planners and NGOs.},

  abstract = {Crime scientists have long known that crime clusters near certain places such as drinking establishments, although the spatial parameters of that clustering are less established. This article proposes a methodology to estimate a distance beyond which there is significantly less evidence of a correlation between locations and concentrations of crime. The technique uses changepoints derived from a segmented regression applied to spatial buffers emanating from around particular crime-generating land uses. Geographic information system techniques are used to create a series of buffers to determine the density of crime around sites. A changepoint Poisson regression of the buffer midpoints is used to estimate the distance beyond which crime densities do not appear to decline significantly with increasing distance. A case study of violent crime around 1,282 bars in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for 2008 reveals that violence is highly clustered within 279m (85 feet) then dissipates rapidly, a pattern that is not replicated using control sites (fire stations). This is an estimate of the spatial extent of violence around bars, and the technique could be used to estimate the extent of other crimes around a variety of crime-generating locations. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Ohio State University.}

Attempts to model SHR on fine scales requires data on the transition probabilities between adjacent pore space and soil OM, a measure of microbial accessibility to the latter. We used a combination of osmium staining and synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (CT) to determine the 3-D (voxel) distribution of these three phases (scale 6.6 {\textmu}m) throughout nine aggregates taken from a single soil core (range of organic carbon (OC) concentrations: 4.2{\textendash}7.7 \%). Prior to the synchrotron analyses we had measured the magnitude of SHR for each aggregate over 24 h under controlled conditions (moisture content and temperature). We test the hypothesis that larger magnitudes of SHR will be observed in aggregates with (i) shorter length scales of OM variation (more aerobic microsites) and (ii) larger transition probabilities between OM and pore voxels.},

  abstract = {Objectives. To test the hypothesis that law enforcement efforts to disrupt local drug markets by seizing opioids or stimulants are associated with increased spatiotemporal clustering of overdose events in the surrounding geographic area. Methods. We performed a retrospective (January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021), population-based cohort study using administrative data from Marion County, Indiana. We compared frequency and characteristics of drug (i.e., opioids and stimulants) seizures with changes in fatal overdose, emergency medical services nonfatal overdose calls for service, and naloxone administration in the geographic area and time following the seizures. Results. Within 7, 14, and 21 days, opioid-related law enforcement drug seizures were significantly associated with increased spatiotemporal clustering of overdoses within radii of 100, 250, and 500 meters. For example, the observed number of fatal overdoses was two-fold higher than expected under the null distribution within 7 days and 500 meters following opioid-related seizures. To a lesser extent, stimulant-related drug seizures were associated with increased spatiotemporal clustering overdose. Conclusions. Supply-side enforcement interventions and drug policies should be further explored to determine whether they exacerbate an ongoing overdose epidemic and negatively affect the nation's life expectancy.

Twenty years ago, gathering data about the human and physical environment was expensive, but now a lot of it is generated as the `exhaust' of day\-to\-day activity: tapping on to the bus or train, taking photos (whether from a satellite, drone, or disposable camera), making phone calls, using our credit cards, and surfing the web. As the costs of capturing, curating, and processing these data sets falls, the discipline of geography is changing; so in this short, deliberately provocative, piece I hope to get you thinking about how the rise of `cheap' creates opportunities that geography students are uniquely positioned to observe, but perhaps poorly trained to exploit.},

After describing four ways to conceptualize the measurement of multigroup segregation-as the disproportionality in group (e.g., race) proportions across organizational units (e.g., schools or census tracts), as the strength of association between nominal variables indexing group and organizational unit membership, as the ratio of between-unit diversity to total diversity, and as the weighted average of two-group segregation indices-we derive six multigroup segregation indices: a dissimilarity index (D), a Gini index (G), an information theory index (H), a squared coefficient of variation index (C), a relative diversity index (R), and a normalized exposure index (P). We evaluate these six indices against a set of seven desirable properties of segregation indices. We conclude that the information theory index H is the most conceptually and mathematically satisfactory index, since it alone obeys the principle of transfers in the multigroup case. Moreover, H is the only multigroup index that can be decomposed into a sum of between- and within-group components.},

  abstract = {Several recent studies have concluded that residential segregation by income in the United States has increased in the decades since 1970, including a significant increase after 2000. Income segregation measures, however, are biased upward when based on sample data. This is a potential concern because the sampling rate of the American Community Survey (ACS){\textemdash}from which post-2000 income segregation estimates are constructed{\textemdash}was lower than that of the earlier decennial censuses. Thus, the apparent increase in income segregation post-2000 may simply reflect larger upward bias in the estimates from the ACS, and the estimated trend may therefore be inaccurate. In this study, we first derive formulas describing the approximate sampling bias in two measures of segregation. Next, using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the bias-corrected estimators eliminate virtually all of the bias in segregation estimates in most cases of practical interest, although the correction fails to eliminate bias in some cases when the population is unevenly distributed among geographic units and the average within-unit samples are very small. We then use the bias-corrected estimators to produce unbiased estimates of the trends in income segregation over the last four decades in large U.S. metropolitan areas. Using these corrected estimates, we replicate the central analyses in four prior studies on income segregation. We find that the primary conclusions from these studies remain unchanged, although the true increase in income segregation among families after 2000 was only half as large as that reported in earlier work. Despite this revision, our replications confirm that income segregation has increased sharply in recent decades among families with children and that income inequality is a strong and consistent predictor of income segregation.},

  abstract = {Data processing for the spatial analysis of small-area social, demographic, and economic data often requires the combination of data spatially aggregated to two or more incompatible zone systems in a region, such as a set of enumeration districts that changes over time. Such situations can be addressed by areal interpolation {\"o} the transfer of data between zonal systems according to spatial algorithms. The authors test a technique of areal interpolation using geographic information systems (GIS) that employs a digital map layer representing streets and roads to derive varying density weights for small areas within aggregation zones. The technique reduces errors in estimation compared with estimates derived using the commonly applied area-weighting technique, with its assumption of uniform density. The street-weighting technique is much easier to use than other interpolation techniques that have also been shown to reduce error compared with area-based weighting.},

  abstract = {The need to combine spatial data representing sociodemographic information across incompatible spatial units is a common problem for demographers. A particular concern is computing small area trends when aggregation zone boundaries change during the trend interval. To that end, this study provides an example of dasymetric areal interpolation using the pre-classified land cover data available through the US Geological Survey's National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) program. Areal interpolation of population estimates is preferable to traditional reaggregation techniques, and the use of land cover data as a weighting factor in interpolated estimation has been shown in earlier studies to be highly accurate. In this study, the NLCD data set performs well and, because it requires no classification, it compares favorably with other land cover data sets for areal interpolation when considered on the basis of accuracy, precision and ease of use.},

Next, it traces the three major types of spatial data problems confronting demographers: the geocoding and geoprocessing of microdata, estimation of detailed population surfaces, and combining data aggregated to incompatible zone systems. GIS and non-GIS solutions to these problems are contrasted, with examples from published research. Spatially pre-processed datasets available to demographers are then discussed. The author concludes by noting that the solutions GIS provides to previously intractable data problems in spatial demography might encourage a focus on dynamic processes of population change in local areas.},

These differences have remained so persistent that Healthy People 2010 specified the elimination of disparities in health as one of its two overarching goals (DHHS, 2002). Included among the health disparities of most concern are those between different racial and ethnic groups and those associated with geography. There is now an emerging consensus that disparities, at least between different racial and ethnic groups, arise from several factors. These include differences in access to care and health insurance and in the amount and quality of care offered and received. They also appear to arise from factors not directly related to the health care system such as socioeconomic status, literacy, language, community factors affecting health, and differences in access to opportunity (Williams, 1999).},

  abstract = {REY S. J. and MONTOURI B. D. (1999) US regional income convergence: a spatial econometric perspective, Reg. Studies 33 , 143-156. This study reconsiders the question of US regional economic income convergence from a spatial econometric perspective. Recently developed methods of exploratory spatial data analysis provide new insights on the geographical dynamics of US regional income growth patterns over the 1929-94 period. Strong patterns of both global and local spatial autocorrelation are found throughout the study period, and the magnitude of global spatial autocorrelation is also found to exhibit strong temporal co-movement with regional income dispersion. A spatial econometric analysis of the familiar Baumol specification reveals strong evidence of misspecification due to ignored spatial error dependence. Because of this dependence, shocks originating in one state can spillover into surrounding states, potentially complicating the transitional dynamics of the convergence process. REY S. J. et MONTOURI B. D. (1999) La convergence du revenu r{\'e}gional aux Etats-Unis: une perspective {\'e}conom{\'e}trique, spatiale, Reg. Studies 33 , 143-156. Cette {\'e}tude remet en cause la convergence du revenu {\'e}conomique r{\'e}gional {\`a} partir d'une perspective {\'e}conom{\'e}trique, spatiale. De nouvelles m{\'e}thodes qui permettent une premi{\`e}re analyse des donn{\'e}es spatiales, fournissent un autre aper{\c c}u sur la dynamique g{\'e}ographique de la r{\'e}partition de la croissance du revenu r{\'e}gional aux Etats-Unis de 1929 {\`a} 1994. Pendant toute la p{\'e}riode {\'e}tudi{\'e}e, de fortes autocorr{\'e}lations g{\'e}ographiques {\`a} la fois globales et locales sont {\`a} noter. Il s'av{\`e}re aussi que l'ampleur de l'autocorr{\'e}lation spatiale, globale va de pair dans le temps avec la dispersion du revenu r{\'e}gional. Une analyse {\'e}conom{\'e}trique, spatiale de la sp{\'e}cification bien connue de Baumol fait preuve de la mauvaise sp{\'e}cification du{\`e} a la d{\'e}pendance vis {\`a} vis des erreurs spatiales {\`a} laquelle on n'a pas fait attention. A cause de cette d{\'e}pendance, des chocs qui proviennent d'un {\'e}tat particulier peuvent avoir des retomb{\'e}es sur les {\'e}tats limitrophes, ce qui risque de compliquer la dynamique transitoire du processusdeconvergence.

Diese Studie behandelt noch einmal die Frage der Konvergenz regionaler Einkommen in den Vereinigten Staaten vom Standpunkt der r{\"a}umlichen {\"O}konometrie aus. K{\"u}rzlich entwickelte Methoden einer Analyse r{\"a}umlicher Untersuchungsdaten verschaffen neue Einsichten in die geographische Dynamik der Muster regionalen Wachstums von Einkommen in den Vereinigten Staaten im Zeitraum 1929- 94. F{\"u}r die genannte Untersuchungsperiode werden robuste Muster globaler wie auch {\"o}rtlicher r{\"a}umlicher Autokorrelationen festgestellt, wobei der Umfang letzterer sich zudem als in kr{\"a}ftigem zeitlichem Gleichschritt mit der Streuung regionaler Einkommen erweist. Eine r{\"a}umliche {\"o}konometrische Analyse der bekannten Baumol Spezifizierung liefert handfeste Beweise fehlerhafter Spezifizierungen infolge unbeachtet gebliebener Abh{\"a}ngigkeit von r{\"a}umlichen Irrt{\"u}mern. Dank dieser Abh{\"a}ngigkeit kann der Schock eines Staates in Nachbarstaaten Kreise ziehen, und die {\"U}bergangsdynamik des Konvergenzprozesses verkomplizieren.},

Whether measured with an explicitly spatial index, or a classic aspatial index, a region's underlying spatial properties could manifest themselves in the magnitude of measured segregation. In this paper we implement a Monte Carlo simulation approach to investigate the properties of four segregation indices in regions built with specific spatial properties. This approach allows us to control the experiment in ways that empirical data do not. In general we confirm the expected results for the indices under various spatial properties, but some unexpected results emerge. Both the Dissimilarity Index and Neighborhood Sorting Index are sensitive to region size, but their spatial counterparts, the Adjusted Dissimilarity Index and Generalized Neighborhood Sorting Index, are generally immune to this problem. The paper also lends weight to concerns about the downward pressure on measured segregation when multiple neighborhoods are grouped into a single census tract. Finally, we discuss concerns about the way space is incorporated into segregation indices since the expected value of the spatial indices tested is lower than their aspatial counterparts.},

Finally, we discuss concerns about the way space is incorporated into segregation indices since the expected value of the spatial indices tested is lower than their aspatial counterparts.},

  abstract = {This article introduces a new approach to measuring neighborhood change. Instead of the traditional method of identifying ``neighborhoods'' a priori and then studying how resident attributes change over time, this approach looks at the neighborhood more intrinsically as a unit that has both a geographic footprint and a socioeconomic composition. Therefore, change is identified when both aspects of a neighborhood transform from one period to the next. The approach is based on a spatial clustering algorithm that identifies neighborhoods at two points in time for one city. The authors also develop indicators of spatial change at both the macro (city) level and the local (neighborhood) scale. The authors illustrate these methods in an application to an extensive database of time-consistent census tracts for 359 of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States for the period 1990-2000.},

  abstract = {Discrete Markov chain models (DMCs) have been widely applied to the study of regional income distribution dynamics and convergence. This popularity reflects the rich body of DMC theory on the one hand and the ability of this framework to provide insights on the internal and external properties of regional income distribution dynamics on the other. In this paper we examine the properties of tests for spatial effects in DMC models of regional distribution dynamics. We do so through a series of Monte Carlo simulations designed to examine the size, power and robustness of tests for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence in transitional dynamics. This requires that we specify a data generating process for not only the null, but also alternatives when spatial heterogeneity or spatial dependence is present in the transitional dynamics. We are not aware of any work which has examined these types of data generating processes in the spatial distribution dynamics literature. Results indicate that tests for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence display good power for the presence of spatial effects. However, tests for spatial heterogeneity are not robust to the presence of strong spatial dependence, while tests for spatial dependence are sensitive to the spatial configuration of heterogeneity. When the spatial configuration can be considered random, dependence tests are robust to the dynamic spatial heterogeneity, but not so to the process mean heterogeneity when the difference in process means is large relative to the variance of the time series.},

The results suggest complex spatial dynamics for both inequality series that were not captured by the stylized model of Alonso. Interpersonal income inequalities of states displayed a U-shaped pattern ending the period at levels that exceeded the alarmingly high patterns that existed in the 1920s. Social inequality is characterized by greater mobility than that found for state per capita incomes. Spatial dependence is also distinct between the two series, with per capita incomes exhibiting strong global spatial autocorrelation, while state interpersonal income inequality does not. Local hot and cold spots are found for the per capita income series, while local spatial outliers are found for state interpersonal inequality. Mobility in both inequality series is found to be influenced by the local spatial context of a state.},

  abstract = {Stochastic dominance tests are used to measure whether distributions are directionally-distinct. Using stochastic dominance measures, an income distribution can be measured to be more favorable for its members at all income levels than another distribution. This contrasts with conventional {$\sigma$} and {$\beta$}-convergence approaches that compare distributions at a set of predetermined income levels. Given this comprehensiveness, stochastic dominance measures can yield novel insight into the relationship between income distributions, and thus to the relative economic welfare of inhabitants of different societies. However, stochastic dominance measures used in the analysis of regional income convergence have ignored the complications of geography. In this paper we examine the properties of common tests for stochastic dominance using various descriptive models of geographically-realistic income growth processes. We find that the false positive rate of stochastic dominance tests increases significantly when comparing spatially-informed income distributions growing over time. Further, this over-eager rejection rate requires only that one distribution be spatially-dependent, unlike some other bivariate statistics. We demonstrate that both the parametric and non-parametric spatial filtering procedures are effective at resolving these issues in restricted circumstances for higher-order dominance tests. Overall, while providing a novel and useful perspective on income distribution dynamics, stochastic dominance measures are demonstrated to have undesirable properties when used in geographically-realistic scenarios and they resist one common method to address these issues. Solutions to the concerns expressed here remain open. (English)},

However, comparisons of the levels of segregation between two, or more, cities at the same point in time can be complicated by different spatial contexts as well as ethnic, racial, and class distributions. The extent to which differences in segregation between two cities is due to differences in spatial structure or to differences in composition remains an open question. This paper develops a framework to disentangle the contributions of spatial structure and composition in carrying out comparative segregation analysis. The approach uses spatially explicit counterfactuals embedded in a Shapley decomposition. We illustrate this framework in a case study of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S.},

Instead, what attention code has received has focused on computational efficiency and scalability issues. In contrast, we have missed the opportunities that the more transformative aspects of code afford as ways to organize our science. These ``big code'' practices hold the potential for addressing some ill effects of big data that have been rightly criticized, such as algorithmic bias, lack of representation, gatekeeping, and issues of power imbalances in our communities. In this article, I consider areas where lessons from the open source community can help us evolve a more inclusive, generative, and expansive GIScience.

We apply classical and spatial Markov chains to measure spatial income dynamics and we employ a decomposition of spatial inequality to measure spatial polarization. In doing so, we ask the following questions: Has spatial inequality increased across Mexican municipios since 2000? What has been the role of place mobility in any changes in overall spatial inequality? Finally, we examine what the main components of place mobility have been over this period. We find evidence of a strong spatial dependency between municipios that has increased over time but we find no clear pattern at the state scale. Intra-state municipal inequality has relatively declined while Inter-state municipal inequality polarization has increased. We also find clear evidence that transitional dynamics of municipio incomes are influenced by spatial context. Substantial evidence shows that municipio income mobility is driven by a growth component that could be likely reflecting the devaluation of the peso over this period. Exchange mobility is found to be a more important component of overall place mobility than dispersion (inequality) mobility.},

Electricity analyses at subcity scales using predefined geographies, such census tracts, might artificially split areas with homogenous characteristics leading to analyses that don't effectively contrast the drivers of energy use. The objective of this study is to use the spatial relationships between demographics, building types, and electricity consumption to form new geographies with less variability for use in residential energy assessment. Using Los Angeles and New York City as case studies, differences in energy use variability within predefined geographies (e.g., census tract) are compared to geographies defined by clustering on socio-technical characteristics. Socio-technical clustering, regardless of the chosen subset of variables, reduces the energy consumption variability over pre-defined geopolitical boundaries with high statistical significance (p{$<<$}0.0001). By clustering, intra-regional variability is reduced by 13\% in Los Angeles and 29\% in New York, therefore improving opportunities for prediction and forecasting. This is the first study to examine the role of spatial boundaries in urban energy assessment. The creation of socio-technical geographies for electricity assessment creates opportunities for improving predictions and forecasts for future sub- and cross-city energy studies.},

  abstract = {As the number of integrated econometric and input-output models appearing in the literature grows, the need for a closer examination of the different approaches towards integration is warranted. This paper suggests a taxonomy of strategies for combining econometric and input-output models at the regional scale. The properties of the different integration strategies are then examined from a theoretical perspective, focusing on the treatment of model closure, dynamic representation. interregional linkages, sectoral aggregation, and estimation issues. Initial empirical insight as to the simulation and impact analysis capabilities of the alternative integration strategies is provided through a series of experiments employing integrated multiregional econometric and input-output models for five regions in Southern California. The results suggest that integrated models as a class can provide for improved forecasting accuracy as well as more comprehensive impact analysis capabilities over traditional non-integrated models. Additional insights are provided regarding the sensitivity of model performance to the choice of integration strategy.},

We analyzed the influence of vehicular fleet growth and restrictions of emission control policy on PM             2.5             changes in all Brazilian urban spots. Our results show an increase in PM             2.5             concentrations (up to 14\%) aligned with an intensive increase (more than 70\%) in the vehicular fleet between 2001 and 2010. We detected a similar pattern in more than 50\% of urban spots in the South-East and other large urban centers in the South and Mid-West regions. The stabilization or reduction of PM             2.5             is associated with a smoothing of fleet growth combined with the continuous restrictions of emission control policy between 2011 and 2020.

We propose a reorientation of this scholarship that incorporates research on neighborhood and school selection and segregation processes. We argue that contextual effects research would be enriched by considering local neighborhood-school structures: the ways that families choose neighborhoods and schools and that neighborhoods and schools mutually and cyclically constitute one another. We conclude with recommendations for bringing neighborhood-school structures to bear on both outcomes-oriented studies of neighborhood and school effects as well as studies of contextual selection and segregation.},

I estimate the effect of gerrymandering on school diversity and school district segregation by comparing the racial/ethnic characteristics of existing attendance zones to those of counterfactual zones expected in the absence of gerrymandering. Results indicate that the gerrymandering of attendance zones generally exacerbates segregation, although it has a weaker effect on the segregation of Whites from Blacks and Hispanics. Gerrymandering is particularly segregative in districts experiencing rapid racial/ethnic change. However, gerrymandering is associated with reductions in segregation in a substantial minority of districts, notably those under desegregation orders.},

Therefore, this study discusses the importance of designing GIS learning material based on spatial thinking. Spatial thinking in this study is used as a basis for developing learning material using concepts of space to explain GIS theory and application, using tools of representation, and using processes of reasoning. This study used a descriptive qualitative approach. Data were collected through observation and questionnaire. Data were analyzed by doing reduction and descriptive statistic. The result of calculating the score of the learning material is 77 percent. It means that GIS learning material based on spatial thinking is needed by the student in learning geography. College students in the Geography Education Program are prospective teachers who will teach GIS to students at schools. Thus, they need to develop GIS learning material based on spatial thinking.},

This possibility is first demonstrated by numerical simulation and then confirmed by a mathematical analysis that enables the parameter range over which the power-law occurs to be quantified. The results are supported by comparison of numerical results with theoretical predictions and general conclusions are drawn regarding mechanisms that can cause this behaviour.},

  abstract = {"Science is how we understand the world. Yet critical flaws in peer review, statistical methods, and publication procedures have rendered a shocking number of scientific studies useless-or worse, badly misleading. Drawing on surprising new data from "meta-science" (the science of how science works), Science Fictions documents the errors that have distorted our knowledge on issues as varied as cancer biology, nutrition, genetics, immigration, education, and extraterrestrial life. Stuart Ritchie's own work challenging an infamous psychology experiment helped spark what's now widely known as the "replication crisis," the realization that many supposed scientific truths cannot be relied upon. Now, he reveals the very human biases, mistakes, and deceptions that undermine the scientific endeavor: from contamination in science labs to the secret vaults of failed studies that nobody gets to see; from outright cheating with fake data to the more common but still ruinous temptation to exaggerate mediocre results for a shot at scientific fame. Yet Science Fictions is far from a counsel of despair. Rather, it's a defense of the scientific method against the pressures and perverse incentives that lead scientists to bend the rules. By illustrating the ways that science goes wrong, Ritchie gives us the knowledge we need to spot dubious research, and points the way to reforms that might save science from itself"--},

This paper pivots from the Rust Belt to the Sunbelt accordingly, disentangling persistence and change in neighborhood median income and concentrated income extremes in Los Angeles County. We first examine patterns of change over two decades starting in 1990 for all Los Angeles neighborhoods. We then analyze an original longitudinal study of approximately six hundred Angelenos from 2000 to 2013, assessing the degree to which contextual changes in neighborhood income arise from neighborhood-\- level mobility or individual residential mobility. Overall we find deep and persistent inequality among both neighborhoods and individuals. Contrary to prior research, we also find that residential mobility does not materially alter neighborhood economic conditions for most race, ethnic, and income groups. Our analyses lay the groundwork for a multilevel theoretical framework capable of explaining spatial inequality across cities and historical eras.},

  abstract = {Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies. However, when performing cross-validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.},

In addition to creating a highly detailed map, the TMP made systematic records of surface remains and collected nearly one million artifacts from roughly 5,000 provenience tracts. Taken together, the spatial, descriptive, and artifactual data collected by the TMP still constitutes one of the most extensive and most detailed records in existence for any ancient city. This paper characterizes and provides an update on TMP surface observations, particularly as they exist in digital format. Several analytical case studies illustrate substantive ways in which these data have been used in the decades since the TMP survey to investigate the culture and history of ancient Teotihuacan. The utility of extensive surface survey data for investigating key urban organizational elements such as neighborhoods and social districts is briefly considered, along with the growing importance of the TMP collections and records as increasingly large parts of Teotihuacan are lost to urban sprawl and destructive agricultural practices.},

  abstract = {We describe a methodology to examine bipartite relational data structures as exemplified in networks of corporate interlocking. These structures can be represented as bipartite graphs of directors and companies, but direct comparison of empirical datasets is often problematic because graphs have different numbers of nodes and different densities. We compare empirical bipartite graphs to simulated random graph distributions conditional on constraints implicit in the observed datasets. We examine bipartite graphs directly, rather than simply converting them to two 1-mode graphs, allowing investigation of bipartite statistics important to connection redundancy and bipartite connectivity. We introduce a new bipartite clustering coefficient that measures tendencies for localized bipartite cycles. This coefficient can be interpreted as an indicator of inter-company and inter-director closeness; but high levels of bipartite clustering have a cost for long range connectivity. We also investigate degree distributions, path lengths, and counts of localized subgraphs. Using this new approach, we compare global structural properties of US and Australian interlocking company directors. By comparing observed statistics against those from the simulations, we assess how the observed graphs are structured, and make comparisons between them relative to the simulated graph distributions. We conclude that the two networks share many similarities and some differences. Notably, both structures tend to be influenced by the clustering of directors on boards, more than by the accumulation of board seats by individual directors; that shared multiple board memberships (multiple interlocks) are an important feature of both infrastructures, detracting from global connectivity (but more so in the Australian case); and that company structural power may be relatively more diffuse in the US structure than in Australia.

  abstract = {Maximum likelihood estimation of Gaussian mixture models with different class-specific covariance matrices is known to be problematic. This is due to the unboundedness of the likelihood, together with the presence of spurious maximizers. Existing methods to bypass this obstacle are based on the fact that unboundedness is avoided if the eigenvalues of the covariance matrices are bounded away from zero. This can be done imposing some constraints on the covariance matrices, i.e. by incorporating a priori information on the covariance structure of the mixture components. The present work introduces a constrained approach, where the class conditional covariance matrices are shrunk towards a pre-specified target matrix {$\Psi$} . Data-driven choices of the matrix {$\Psi$} , when a priori information is not available, and the optimal amount of shrinkage are investigated. Then, constraints based on a data-driven {$\Psi$} are shown to be equivariant with respect to linear affine transformations, provided that the method used to select the target matrix be also equivariant. The effectiveness of the proposal is evaluated on the basis of a simulation study and an empirical example.},

Up to now, in the undirected case, the closeness of actors in such networks has been measured by their jointly-attended events. Indirect contacts and attenuated and directed links are of minor interest in affiliation networks. These flaws make a veritable estimation of, e.g., possible message transfers amongst actors questionable. In this contribution, first, we discuss these matters from a graph-theoretical point of view. Second, so as to avoid the identified weaknesses, we propose an up-and-coming entropy-based approach for modeling such networks in their generic structure, replacing directed (attenuated) links by conditionals: if-then. In this framework, the contribution of actors and events to a reliable message transfer from one actor to another{\textemdash}even via intermediaries{\textemdash}is then calculated applying the principle of maximum entropy. The usefulness of this new approach is demonstrated by the analysis of an affiliation network called ``corporate directors''.},

Poor development prospects and an increasing belief that these places have ``no future''{\textemdash}as economic dynamism has been posited to be increasingly dependent on agglomeration economies{\textemdash}have led many of these so-called ``places that don't matter'' to revolt against the status quo. The revolt has come via an unexpected source: the ballot-box, in a wave of political populism with strong territorial, rather than social foundations. I will argue that the populist wave is challenging the sources of existing well-being in both the less-dynamic and the more prosperous areas and that better, rather than more, place-sensitive territorial development policies are needed in order to find a solution to the problem. Place-sensitive development policies need, however, to stay clear of the welfare, income support and big investment projects of past development strategies if they are to be successful and focus on tapping into untapped potential and on providing opportunities to those people living in the places that ``don't matter''.},

Less developed cities {\textemdash}defined as cities whose GDP per capita is below 75\% of the national average{\textemdash} also innovate but innovate far less. And how they manage to do so is not sufficiently understood. This paper explores the processes of innovation in China's more and less developed cities. We develop an econometric analysis involving 283 Chinese cities between 2003 and 2014 to address: (a) what are the socioeconomic and structural factors that govern processes of innovation in Chinese cities? And (b) how do these factors differ between more and less developed cities? The analysis indicates that China's more and less developed cities innovate in markedly different ways. The innovation systems of China's more developed cities are more complex, integrated and mature {\textemdash}leveraging knowledge from R\&D activities, large human capital endowments and inter-city spillovers{\textemdash} than those that have emerged in the country's less developed cities. Innovation in less developed cities also suffers from the lower capacity of these cities to generate knowledge synergies.},

  abstract = {During the last third of the twentieth century, political philosophers actively debated about the content of distributive justice; the ruling ethical view of utilitarianism was challenged by various versions of equality of opportunities. Economists formulated several ways of modeling these ideas, focusing upon how individuals are placed with respect to opportunities for achieving various outcomes, and what compensation is due to individuals with truncated opportunities. After presenting a review of the main philosophical ideas (section 2), we turn to economic models (sections 3 and 4). We propose a reformulation of the definition of economic development, replacing the utilitarian measure of GDP per capita with a measure of the degree to which opportunities for income acquisition in a nation have been equalized. Finally, we discuss issues that the econometrician faces in measuring inequality of opportunity, briefly review the empirical literature (section 6), and conclude (section 7).

In contrast, prospective methods treat a series of observations sequentially, with the aim of detecting quickly any changes that occur in the series. In this paper, cumulative sum methods of monitoring are adapted for use with Knox's space-time statistic. The result is a procedure for the rapid detection of any emergent space-time interactions for a set of sequentially monitored point events. The approach relies on a 'local' Knox statistic that is useful in retrospective analyses to detect when and where space-time interaction occurs. The distribution of the local Knox statistic under the null hypothesis of no space-time interaction is derived. The retrospective local statistic and the prospective cumulative sum monitoring method are illustrated by using previously published data on Burkitt's lymphoma in Uganda.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables{\textemdash}colliders and mediators{\textemdash}should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

Deciphering spatial phenotypic and molecular effects on the single-cell level is one of the grand challenges and a key to understanding the effects of cell{\textendash}cell interactions and microenvironment. However, spatial information is usually overlooked by downstream data analyses, which usually consider single-cell read-out values as independent measurements for further averaging or clustering, thus disregarding spatial locations. With this work, we attempt to fill this gap. We developed a toolbox that allows one to test for the presence of a spatial effect in microscopy images of adherent cells and estimate the spatial scale of this effect. The proposed Python module can be used for any light microscopy images of cells as well as other types of single-cell data such as in situ transcriptomics or metabolomics. The input format of our package matches standard output formats from image analysis tools such as CellProfiler, Fiji, or Icy and thus makes our toolbox easy and straightforward to use, yet offering a powerful statistical approach for a wide range of applications. {\textcopyright} 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

Across the world, more people travel by bicycle than by any other form of transportation. Almost anyone can learn to ride a bike-and nearly everyone does. In Two Wheels Good, writer and critic Jody Rosen reshapes our understanding of this ubiquitous machine, an ever-present force in humanity's life and dreamlife-and a flashpoint in culture wars-for more for than two hundred years. Combining history, reportage, travelogue, and memoir, Rosen sweeps across centuries and around the globe, unfolding the bicycle's saga from its invention in 1817 to its present-day renaissance as a "green machine," an emblem of sustainability in a world afflicted by pandemic and climate change. Readers meet unforgettable characters: feminist rebels who steered bikes to the barricades in the 1890s, a prospector who pedaled across the frozen Yukon to join the Klondike gold rush, a Bhutanese king who races mountain bikes in the Himalayas, a cycle rickshaw driver who navigates the seething streets of the world's fastest-growing megacity, astronauts who ride a floating bicycle in zero gravity aboard the International Space Station"--},

  abstract = {The cartogram, or value-by-area map, is a popular technique for cartographically representing social data. Such maps visually equalize a basemap before mapping a social variable by adjusting the size of each enumeration unit by a second, related variable. However, to scale the basemap units according to an equalizing variable, cartograms must distort the shape and/or topology of the original geography. Such compromises reduce the effectiveness of the visualisation for elemental and general map-reading tasks. Here we describe a new kind of representation, termed a value-by-alpha map, which visually equalizes the basemap by adjusting the alpha channel, rather than the size, of each enumeration unit. Although not without its own limitations, the value-by-alpha map is able to circumvent the compromise inherent to the cartogram form, perfectly equalizing the basemap while preserving both shape and topology.},

  abstract = {Prior studies suggest that middle-income Americans are more likely to move to predominately white, low-income neighbourhoods than predominately black or Latino neighbourhoods. Given that black and Latino neighbourhoods are, on average, lower income and higher in poverty than low-income, white neighbourhoods, it may be that gentrification in these neighbourhoods is a different kind of change than that occurring in predominately white neighbourhoods. Using Census data from 1970 to 2010 for 275 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, I find that racial composition influences not only whether gentrification occurs, but how it occurs and whether it influences racial demographics. Majority white gentrifying tracts were more likely to experience an increase in higher-income residents and white residents, while majority non-white gentrifying tracts experienced an increase in higher-educated but not higher-income residents, and an increase in white residents and decrease in black and Latino residents. Racial composition thus contributed to the kind of gentrification that a tract experienced and the extent to which gentrification produced racial change. These findings suggest that race affects not only where gentrification occurs, as previously established, but also the kind of class and racial changes a neighbourhood experiences. Ultimately, this article suggests that gentrification neither unfolds in one way nor affects all neighbourhoods the same way.},

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

  abstract = {Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, has long-term issues with inequalities in health and food security, as well as large areas of vacant and derelict land. Urban agriculture projects can increase access to fresh food, improve mental health and nutrition, and empower and bring communities together. We investigated the distribution of urban agriculture in Glasgow and found that the current configuration of urban agriculture projects is mostly located centrally in the city, covering 36~\% of the total population (approximately 635,000) within 10-minute walking distance. We also found a positive correlation (r~=~0.13, p~=~0.0003) between the walking travel time to the nearest urban agriculture project and the food desert status. To increase urban agriculture access across the city, we used the Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) model to optimally situate new urban agriculture projects on vacant and derelict land to maximize the covered population. We identified that a minimum of 15 new urban agriculture projects could increase the population coverage to 49~\% and equalize the access disparity to a statistically non-significant level. This research shows that converting vacant and derelict land in Glasgow into urban agriculture projects could both help with the city's problem of vacant and derelict land and bring many potential benefits to local communities.},

The second approach also introduces the idea of geographic convolution in neural networks, which aims to mirror in the geographical domain the approach of graphical convolution, which has revolutionised image processes in the past decade. To test our approaches, we created a geodemographic classification based on the United Kingdom Census 2011 for the county of Leicestershire and compared it to the official 2011 Output Area Classification. Our results show that the two deep neural networks are successful in creating classifications which are statistically similar to the official classification and demonstrate high cluster homogeneity.},

Meanwhile, spatial data has become ubiquitous, e.g., GPS data, with increasingly sheer sizes in recent years. The applications of big spatial data span a wide spectrum of interests including tracking infectious disease, climate change simulation, drug addiction, among others. Consequently, major research efforts are exerted to support efficient analysis and intelligence inside these applications by either providing spatial extensions to existing machine learning solutions or building new solutions from scratch. In this 90-minutes tutorial, we comprehensively review the state-of-the-art work in the intersection of machine learning and big spatial data. We cover existing research efforts and challenges in three major areas of machine learning, namely, data analysis, deep learning and statistical inference. We also discuss the existing end-to-end systems, and highlight open problems and challenges for future research in this area.},

  abstract = {Spatial analysis often treats a set of polygons distributed with overlap in a region. Daily variation of the market area of a supermarket is represented by a set of overlapping polygons in geographic information systems and analyzed to grasp consumers' purchase behavior. The distribution of ethnic groups is also represented as a set of polygons, and relations among these polygons are discussed in cultural geography. To assist the exploratory analysis of polygons, this article proposes a new method of analyzing the relations among polygons. The method permits us to understand the entire structure of the relations among polygons and to detect local spatial patterns in these relations. The Hasse diagram and its extension are introduced to describe the topological structure of polygons. These tools are effective especially for describing hierarchical relations among polygons. The extension of the Hasse diagram also provides a means of classifying polygons, which is useful for discussing similarities and differences among them. The method is employed to analyze the results of an experiment in environmental psychology. Discussion focuses on technical soundness of and empirical findings obtained with the method. En an{\'a}lisis espacial, es com{\'u}n representar y analizar conjuntos de pol{\'i}gonos con traslapes en una regi{\'o}n. La variaci{\'o}n diaria de la zona de mercado de un supermercado, por ejemplo, es representada por medio de un conjunto de pol{\'i}gonos traslapados en un Sistema de Informaci{\'o}n Geogr{\'a}fico (GIS), el cual es analizado para comprender el comportamiento de compra de consumidores. La distribuci{\'o}n de los grupos {\'e}tnicos tambi{\'e}n es representada como un conjunto de pol{\'i}gonos, mientras que las relaciones entre dichos pol{\'i}gonos es abordado con conceptos de geograf{\'i}a cultural. Para apoyar al an{\'a}lisis exploratorio de los pol{\'i}gonos como {\'e}stos, los autores proponen un nuevo m{\'e}todo de an{\'a}lisis de las relaciones entre pol{\'i}gonos. El m{\'e}todo permite comprender toda la estructura de las relaciones entre pol{\'i}gonos y detectar patrones espaciales locales en estas relaciones. Los autores utilizan el diagrama de Hasse y proponen ciertas ampliaciones al m{\'e}todo para describir la estructura topol{\'o}gica de pol{\'i}gonos. Estas herramientas son efectivas especialmente para la descripci{\'o}n de las relaciones jer{\'a}rquicas entre los pol{\'i}gonos. La ampliaci{\'o}n del diagrama de Hasse tambi{\'e}n proporciona un m{\'e}todo para clasificar pol{\'i}gonos que es {\'u}til para tratar de similitudes y diferencias entre ellos. El m{\'e}todo propuesto es empleado para analizar los resultados de un experimento en psicolog{\'i}a ambiental. La discusi{\'o}n se centra en la solidez t{\'e}cnica y en los resultados emp{\'i}ricos obtenidos con el m{\'e}todo. 空间分析通常将同个区域的一组多边形分布的图层进行叠加。在GIS系统中对一组超市市场区日常变化的多边形进行叠加分析可掌握消费者的购买行为。种族分布同样可由一组多边形表征，并可在文化地理学框架下进行这些多边形要素间的相关性分析。为支持多边形的探索性分析，本文提出了一种用于分析多边形间关系的新方法。该方法有助于理解多边形间关系的整体结构，并可探测局部空间格局。Hasse图及其扩展用于描述多边形的拓扑结构，对描述图层的层次关系尤为有效。Hasse图的扩展也提供了多边形分类的手段，这对于讨论它们之间的异同性是十分有效。最后，将该方法用于环境心理学试验结果的分析，讨论主要侧重于技术的合理性分析及从该方法得到的经验认识。},

Physical distances between agents are modeled in different ways and used as explanatory variables in exponential random graph modeling. The paper shows that spatial configuration in offices can be considered an important but not sole rationale for tie formation. Furthermore, it is shown that spatial distance measures based on detailed configurational analysis outperform simple Euclidean distance metrics in predicting social ties.},

Poverty rates and head counts are reported for four specific poverty lines. Rates in 2000 were between one-third and one-half of what they were in 1970 for all four lines. There were between 250 and 500 million fewer poor in 2000 than in 1970. We estimate eight indexes of income inequality implied by our world distribution of income. All of them show reductions in global inequality during the 1980s and 1990s.}

Using survey data collected in 1995 from 8,782 Chicago residents, we examine variations in intergenerational closure, reciprocal local ex- change, and shared expectations for informal social control across 342 neighborhoods. Adjusting for respondents' attributes, we assess the effects of neighborhood characteristics measured in the 1990 census and the role of spatial interdependence. The results show that residential stability and con- centrated affluence, more so than poverty and racial/ethnic composition, pre- dict intergenerational closure and reciprocal exchange. Concentrated dis- advantage, by contrast, is associated with sharply lower expectations for shared child control. The importance of spatial dynamics in generating col- lective efficacy for children is highlighted-proximity to areas high in clo- sure, exchange, and control bestows an advantage above and beyond the structural characteristics of a given neighborhood. Moreover, spatial advan- tages are much more likely to accrue to white neighborhoods than to black neighborhoods.},

Based on the videotaping and systematic rating of more than 23,000 street segments in Chicago, highly reliable scales of social and physical disorder for 196 neighborhoods are constructed. Census data, police records, and an independent survey of more than 3,500 residents are then integrated to test a theory of collective efficacy and structural constraints. Defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control of public space, collective efficacy explains lower rates of crime and observed disorder after controlling neighborhood structural characteristics. Collective efficacy is also linked to lower rates of violent crime after accounting for disorder and the reciprocal effects of violence. Contrary to the "broken windows" theory, however, the relationship between public disorder and crime is spurious except perhaps for robbery.

  abstract = {The use of geodemographic analysis has a long history, arguably stretching back to Charles Booth's Descriptive Map of London's Poverty, produced in 1886 and the published classification of areas has invariably been based on all residents. The work described in this paper, however, is novel in the use of geodemographic analysis to focus on a single minority group within a national census. This paper describes the development of a methodology which allows geodemographic analysis to be applied to unevenly distributed minority sub-populations, overcoming two particular issues: finding a suitable geographic base to ensure data reliability; and developing a methodology to avoid known weaknesses in certain clustering techniques, specifically distortion caused by outlier cases and generation of sub-optimal local minimum solutions. The approach, which includes a visual element to final classification selection, has then been applied to establish the degree to which the Jewish population in an area is similar in character to, or differs from, Jews living in other areas of England and Wales, using data from the 2011 census. That group has been selected because of the maturity of its presence in Britain {\textemdash} study of this group may point the way for examination of other, more recently arrived, sub-populations. Previous studies have generally assumed homogeneity amongst `mainstream' Jews and have not considered spatial variation, separating out only strictly orthodox enclaves. This paper demonstrates that there are indeed distinct socio-economic and demographic differences between Jewish groups in different areas, not fully attributable to the underlying mainstream social geography, whilst also identifying a strong degree of spatial clustering; it also establishes the practicality of applying geodemographic analysis to minority groups.},

  abstract = {A novel approach is described to developing population projections for minority groups for whom information used in traditional approaches is not directly available. Geodemographic assessment is a powerful tool for simplifying and interpreting complex patterns; but fixed classifications have rarely been used to compare and contrast population characteristics found in consecutive decennial censuses and establish trends for the future. This paper describes an innovative projection methodology, using an existing geodemographic classification and standard census outputs, that addresses and overcomes three challenges: the application of a geodemographic classification to a minority group {\textendash}the Jewish residents of England and Wales {\textendash} across multiple points in time; analysis of changes in that population between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, by geodemographic class; and the development of a projection based on these recent observed trends. The approach adopted specifically allows for temporal changes in the influence of population characteristics. The balance between the impact of births, deaths and migration on area / class population over time is determined and, after consideration of future fertility and mortality levels, used to develop class-by-class population projections for Anglo-Jewry and an overall projection for 2021 and 2031. The analysis indicates that there will be material differences between the demographic futures of the areas in which the various classes are found, and predicts a reversal in the numerical decline of the Jewish population that has prevailed over the last half century. As a result, the projections raise significant policy implications; additionally, the approach could be applied to other groups and other places.},

  abstract = {Scholars have debated whether students' enrollment in private schools changes levels of racial segregation across urban school districts. The authors examine this issue by comparing the actual racial composition of schools with the racial composition of school-aged children living in the corresponding attendance areas. They do so by linking maps of school attendance boundaries with 2000 census data, the Common Core of Data, and the Private School Survey for the 22 largest U.S. school districts. The results show that public schools would be less racially segregated if all children living in a school district attended their neighborhood schools. In addition, private, magnet, and charter schools contribute to overall racial segregation within many school districts. The effects are particularly striking for segregation between white and Hispanic children. Finally, a few school districts with desegregation policies have succeeded in reducing racial segregation. The analyses contribute to debates regarding recent proposals to eliminate desegregation programs while simultaneously expanding ``free-market'' educational reforms that promote students' mobility across public, private, and charter schools.},

Although geographers have developed a variety of interpolation techniques to address the challenge of reallocating data across misaligned geography, there has been limited use of these methods in sociological research. As a result of the scant use of interpolation methods by researchers, the accuracy of these methods has not been assessed adequately with empirical data typically encountered by sociologists. To address this shortcoming, the authors describe four ways of reassigning data across incompatible zonal systems and test the accuracy of each approach with two case studies. The first example reassigns racial data from block groups to school attendance boundaries for selected school systems and the second reassigns racial data from school districts to Public Use Micro Areas for the entire US.},

  abstract = {A recent review noted important differences in the results of the local Moran's statistic depending on the inference method. These differences had significant practical implications. In closing, the authors speculated the differences may be due to local spatial heterogeneity. In this article, we propose that different null hypotheses, not heteroskedasticity, generate these differences. To test this, we examine the null hypotheses implicit in common statistical significance tests of local Moran's . We design an experiment to assess the impact of local heterogeneity on tests conducted under the two most common null hypotheses. In this experiment, we analyze the relationship between measures of local variance, such as the local spatial heteroskedasticity (LOSH) statistic, and components of the local Moran's statistic. We run this experiment with controlled synthetic heteroskedastic data and with uncontrolled real-world data with varying degrees and patterns of local heteroskedasticity. We show that, in both situations, estimates that use the same null are extremely similar, regardless of estimation method. In contrast, all estimates (regardless of the null) are moderately affected by spatial heteroskedasticity. Ultimately, this article demonstrates that there are important conceptual and computational differences about null hypothesis in local testing frameworks, and these differences can have significant practical implications. Therefore, researchers must be aware as to how their choices may shape the observed spatial patterns.},

We develop a new model in which patients choose the primary care location that minimizes their combined accessibility and availability costs. This model offers several advantages with respect to existing access frameworks. It incorporates feedback between patient decisions and endogenizes the trade-off between travel times and congestion at the point of care. It allows for patients to seek care from their home or workplace and can account for multiple travel modes. Our open-sourced implementation scales efficiently to large areas and fine spatial granularity. Using distributed computing, we calculate travel times for this model at the census tract level for the entire United States, and we also make this resource available. We compare the results to those from existing primary care access models. Key Words: floating catchment areas, primary health care, rational agent models, spatial accessibility.}

In practice, the use of such indices has been impeded by the lack of open resources and the computational burden associated with large scale analyses. The environment consists of three parts: a new package, access, as part of the Python-based PySAL Spatial Analysis Library, a user-friendly point-and-click web implementation of the access computations, and support for the calculation of large-scale travel cost matrices, including a set of pre-computed origin-destination distance matrices for all the census tracts in the U.S. and census blocks in the 20 major cities. All three elements are open source and free to use. After motivating the development of the software environment, and situating the problem of access measurement in the literature, we briefly describe six commonly used access metrics. We then discuss in more detail the three important components of our software infrastructure. We close with an empirical illustration pertaining to access to health care providers, comparing the approach in the package to that taken in the web application.},

  abstract = {Spatio-temporal disease mapping models are a popular tool to describe the pattern of disease counts. They are usually formulated in a hierarchical Bayesian framework with latent Gaussian model. So far, computationally expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms have been used for parameter estimation which might induce a large Monte Carlo error. An alternative method using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) has recently been proposed. A major advantage of INLA is that it returns accurate parameter estimates in short computational time. Additionally, the deviance information criterion is provided for Bayesian model choice. This paper describes how several parametric and nonparametric models and extensions thereof can be fitted to space{\textendash}time count data using INLA. Particular emphasis is given to the appropriate choice of linear constraints to ensure identifiability of the parameter estimates. The models are applied to counts of Salmonellosis in cattle reported to the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office 1991{\textendash}2008. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {To measure population changes in areas where census unit boundaries do not align across time, a common approach is to interpolate data from one census's units to another's. This article presents a broad assessment of areal interpolation models for estimating counts of 2000 characteristics in 2010 census units throughout the United States. We interpolate from 2000 census block data using 4 types of ancillary data to guide interpolation: 2010 block densities, imperviousness data, road buffers, and water body polygons. We test 8 binary dasymetric (BD) models and 8 target-density weighting (TDW) models, each using a unique combination of the 4 ancillary data types, and derive 2 hybrid models that blend the best-performing BD and TDW models. The most accurate model is a hybrid that generally gives high weight to TDW (allocating 2000 data in proportion to 2010 densities) but gives increasing weight to a BD model (allocating data uniformly within developed land near roads) in proportion to the estimated 2000{\textendash}2010 rate of change within each block. Although for most 2010 census units, this hybrid model's estimates differ little from the simplest model's estimates, there are still many areas where the estimates differ considerably. Estimates from the final model, along with lower and upper bounds for each estimate, are publicly available for over 1000 population and housing characteristics at 10 geographic levels via the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS {\textendash} http://nhgis.org).},

  abstract = {Objectives: This study tested whether a varied set of perceived characteristics of neighborhood (i.e., social cohesion, safety, aesthetic quality, violence) predicted stressor frequency and severity as well as negative emotional responses to stressors. We predicted greater reported cohesion and safety and less violence would be associated with less frequent stressor exposure and severity and less intense negative affect following stressors; we conducted subsequent tests of neighborhood aesthetic quality as a predictor. Methods: Participants (n = 233, age 25{\textendash}65 years) were residents in a socio-economically, racially, and ethnically diverse zip code in Bronx, New York, most who participated in the Effects of Stress on Cognitive Aging, Physiology and Emotion study between 2012 and 2013. They provided demographic information and neighborhood ratings, then participated in the EMA protocol in which they completed brief smartphone surveys of current negative affect and stressor exposure, severity, and recency, five times daily for 14 days. Results: No coded neighborhood characteristic was related to the frequency of stressors. Individuals who reported greater neighborhood violence, however, rated their stressors as more severe. Individuals rating their neighborhood lower in safety or aesthetic quality, or higher in violence, had greater negative affect following stressors. Conclusion: Even among people living within the same zip code, individual differences in perceptions of neighborhood predict how stressful they appraised stressors in daily life to be and how much negative affect they reported following stressors.},

We examined the relationship between an adverse environmental factor (alcohol outlet overconcentration), segregated neighborhoods, and county alcohol policy in Louisiana and Alabama to investigate this link. Multilevel analysis revealed high outlet density associated with segregated counties and predominantly black census tracts in counties with restrictive alcohol policy. This inverse association between policies designed to limit alcohol availability and overconcentration of outlets in black neighborhoods warrants consideration by policymakers given links between outlet density and health inequities. Consideration of these findings in historical context suggests these policies may function as a contemporary actualization of the historical use of alcohol policy to subjugate black people in the South, now over-concentrating instead of prohibiting access.},

  abstract = {Abstract              John Wesley Powell, in the nineteenth century, introduced the notion that the 100th meridian divides the North American continent into arid western regions and humid eastern regions. This concept remains firmly fixed in the national imagination. It is reexamined in terms of climate, hydrology, vegetation, land use, settlement, and the agricultural economy. It is shown there is a stark east{\textendash}west gradient in aridity roughly at the 100th meridian that is well expressed in hydroclimate, soil moisture, and ``potential vegetation.'' The gradient arises from atmospheric circulations and moisture transports. In winter, the arid regions west of the 100th meridian are shielded from Pacific storm-related precipitation and are too far west to benefit from Atlantic storms. In summer, the southerly flow on the western flank of the North Atlantic subtropical high has a westerly component over the western plains, bringing air from the interior southwest, but it also brings air from the Gulf of Mexico over the eastern plains, generating a west{\textendash}east moisture transport and precipitation gradient. The aridity gradient is realized in soil moisture and a west-to-east transition from shortgrass to tallgrass prairie. The gradient is sharp in terms of greater fractional coverage of developed land east of the 100th meridian than to the west. Farms are fewer but larger west of the meridian, reflective of lower land productivity. Wheat and corn cultivation preferentially occur west and east of the 100th meridian, respectively. The 100th meridian is a very real arid{\textendash}humid divide in the physical climate and landscape, and this has exerted a powerful influence on human settlement and agricultural development.},

Prior research has struggled to explain the disparity in alcohol use between blacks and whites but not for a lack of potential mediating mechanisms. The current study draws on differential association theory and two waves of panel data (n=1,016) to examine the influence of interracial friendship, the racial composition of peer groups, and communities on black-white differences in alcohol use. Findings indicate that (1) the racial composition of peer groups and communities influence changes in alcohol use, and (2) racial segregation contributes to racial disparities in alcohol use while interracial friendship reduces these disparities. Results suggest that the socially conservative values of the African-American community are a strong deterrent to adolescent drinking, affecting even those adolescents who are themselves white but associate with black youth. {\textcopyright} 2012 Midwest Sociological Society.},

  abstract = {A large number of complex systems find a natural abstraction in the form of weighted networks whose nodes represent the elements of the system and the weighted edges identify the presence of an interaction and its relative strength. In recent years, the study of an increasing number of large-scale networks has highlighted the statistical heterogeneity of their interaction pattern, with degree and weight distributions that vary over many orders of magnitude. These features, along with the large number of elements and links, make the extraction of the truly relevant connections forming the network's backbone a very challenging problem. More specifically, coarse-graining approaches and filtering techniques come into conflict with the multiscale nature of large-scale systems. Here, we define a filtering method that offers a practical procedure to extract the relevant connection backbone in complex multiscale networks, preserving the edges that represent statistically significant deviations with respect to a null model for the local assignment of weights to edges. An important aspect of the method is that it does not belittle small-scale interactions and operates at all scales defined by the weight distribution. We apply our method to real-world network instances and compare the obtained results with alternative backbone extraction techniques.},

However, methods for quantifying uncertainty in such models are usually developed in an academic environment and in most cases do not reach users of official forecasts, such as planners and policymakers. In this paper, we describe the practical application of a methodology called Bayesian melding and its integration into the land-use forecast published by the Puget Sound Regional Council, a metropolitan planning organization. e method allows practitioners to assess uncertainty about forecasted quantities, such as households, population, and jobs, for each geographic unit. Users are provided with probability intervals around forecasts, which add value to model validation, scenario comparison, and external review and comment procedures. Practical issues such as how many runs to use or assessing uncertainty for aggregated regions are also discussed.},

From a graph theoretic point of view, a cluster graph is a vertex-disjoint union of cliques. The clustering problem is the task of making the fewest changes to the edge set of an input graph so that it becomes a cluster graph. We study the complexity of three variants of the problem. In the Cluster Completion variant edges can only be added. In Cluster Deletion, edges can only be deleted. In Cluster Editing, both edge additions and edge deletions are allowed. We also study these variants when the desired solution must contain a prespecified number of clusters. We show that Cluster Editing is NP-complete, Cluster Deletion is NP-hard to approximate to within some constant factor, and Cluster Completion is polynomial. When the desired solution must contain exactly p clusters, we show that Cluster Editing is NP-complete for every p{$\geqslant$}2; Cluster Deletion is polynomial for p=2 but NP-complete for p{$>$}2; and Cluster Completion is polynomial for any p. We also give a constant factor approximation algorithm for a variant of Cluster Editing when p=2.},

PSID data are analyzed to reveal remarkable continuity in neighborhood economic status from one generation to the next. The primary consequence of persistent neighborhood stratification is that the racial inequality in America's neighborhoods that existed a generation ago has been transmitted, for the most part unchanged, to the current generation. More than 70\% of black children who grow up in the poorest quarter of American neighborhoods remain in the poorest quarter of neighborhoods as adults, compared to 40\% of whites. The results suggest that racial inequality in neighborhood economic status is substantially underestimated with short-term measures of neighborhood income or poverty and, second, that the steps taken to end racial discrimination in the housing and lending markets have not enabled black Americans to advance out of America's poorest neighborhoods.},

Data from two sources{\textemdash}the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics{\textemdash}are used to provide complementary analyses of trajectories of change in geographic location and neighborhood racial and economic composition during young adulthood. Findings indicate that for young adults who originate in segregated urban areas and remain in such areas, the period of young adulthood is characterized by continuity in neighborhood conditions and persistent racial inequality from childhood to adulthood. For young adults who exit highly segregated urban areas, this period is characterized by a substantial leveling of racial inequality, with African Americans moving into lesspoor, less-segregated neighborhoods. However, the trend toward racial equality in young adulthood is temporary, as the gaps between whites and blacks grow as the young adults move further into adulthood. Crucial to the reemergence of racial inequality in neighborhood environments is the process of ``unselected'' change, or change in neighborhood conditions that occurs around young adults after they move to a new neighborhood environment.},

  abstract = {Climate change is real but it's not the end of the world. It is not even our most serious environmental problem. Michael Shellenberger has been fighting for a greener planet for decades. He helped save the world's last unprotected redwoods. He cocreated the predecessor to today's Green New Deal. And he led a successful effort by climate scientists and activists to keep nuclear plants operating, preventing a spike of emissions. But in 2019, as some claimed "billions of people are going to die," contributing to rising anxiety, including among adolescents, Shellenberger decided that as a lifelong environmental activist, leading energy expert, and father of a teenage daughter, he needed to speak out to separate science from fiction. Despite decades of news media attention, many remain ignorant of basic facts. Carbon emissions peaked and have been declining in most developed nations for more than a decade. Deaths from extreme weather, even in poor nations, declined 80 percent over the last four decades. And the risk of the Earth warming to very high temperatures is increasingly unlikely thanks to slowing population growth and abundant natural gas. Curiously, the people who are the most alarmist about the problems also tend to oppose the obvious solutions. What's really behind the rise of apocalyptic environmentalism? There are powerful financial interests. There are desires for status and power. But most of all there is a desire among supposedly secular people for transcendence. This spiritual impulse can be natural and healthy. But in preaching fear without love, and guilt without redemption, the new religion is failing to satisfy our deepest psychological and existential needs. - Jacket flap},

According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, in 2019/20 only 28\% of professors were women, 3.2\% of professors were women and disabled, and 3.6\% of professors were women and from a Black, Asian, or Minority Ethnic (BAME) background. Research on gender in HE varies in scale and methodological practice, from large scale global surveys to small scale projects with interviews and focus groups, with more attention focused on women working in UK HE, and not always on early career researchers and doctoral students. Drawing on gender theory to link gender to power and gendered organisations, we connect this theoretical perspective to research on gender in HE. This paper proposes a new agenda to push forward our understanding of gender in HE by drawing together quantitative and feminist geography to focus on the issue at the different platial scales within HE. We propose expanding the definition of gender often used in quantitative research, focusing on intersectionality, using open source data sets to provide new data, and using quantitative geography methods to frame a multi-scalar understanding of gender in HE.},

  abstract = {Korea has pursued a cluster-based policy to increase industrial competitiveness and to alleviate development gaps between the regions. However, local governments have often oversupplied clusters without an objective examination of the demands and conditions in the regions. Based on these concerns, this study analyses effects and interdependencies of factors related to regional innovation and growth in Korea. Employing a PCA method and a GLS regression models on panel data, we generated three composite factors, social, capacity, and clustering, and estimated their effects on regional economic performance. The results show that it is important to have a favorable socio-economic setting to foster growth by clusters. In addition, cluster-based policies may have weaker effects than expected, because the effect of R\&D capacity on regional growth was stronger and longer lasting. Finally, some specific elements that most affected economic growth in Korea's regions are identified. The overall results indicate favorable environments should be established beforehand to foster regional growth with clusters, which confirms ``jobs follow people.''},

  abstract = {A classic problem in planning is districting, which aims to partition a given area into a specified number of subareas according to required criteria. Size, compactness, and contiguity are among the most frequently used districting criteria. While size and compactness may be interpreted differently in different contexts, contiguity is an unambiguous topological property. A district is said to be contiguous if all locations in it are `connected'{\"o}that is, one can travel between any two locations in the district without leaving it. This paper introduces a new integer-programming-based approach to districting modeling, which enforced contiguity constraints independently of any other criteria that might be additionally imposed. Three experimental models are presented, and tested with sample data on the forty-eight conterminous US states. A major implication of this paper is that the exact formulation of a contiguity requirement allows planners to address diverse sets of districting criteria.},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to advance neighbourhood change research and complexity theories of cities by developing and exploring a Markov model of socio-spatial neighbourhood evolution in Toronto, Canada. First, we classify Toronto neighbourhoods into distinct groups using established geodemographic segmentation techniques, a relatively novel application in this geographic setting. Extending previous studies, we pursue a hierarchical approach to classifying neighbourhoods that situates many neighbourhood types within the city's broader structure. Our hierarchical approach is able to incorporate a richer set of types than most past research and allows us to study how neighbourhoods' positions within this hierarchy shape their trajectories of change. Second, we use Markov models to identify generative processes that produce patterns of change in the city's distribution of neighbourhood types. Moreover, we add a spatial component to the Markov process to uncover the extent to which change in one type of neighbourhood depends on the character of nearby neighbourhoods. In contrast to the few studies that have explored Markov models in this research tradition, we validate the model's predictive power. Third, we demonstrate how to use such models in theoretical scenarios considering the impact on the city's predicted evolutionary trajectory when existing probabilities of neighbourhood transitions or distributions of neighbourhood types would hypothetically change. Markov models of transition patterns prove to be highly accurate in predicting the final distribution of neighbourhood types. Counterfactual scenarios empirically demonstrate urban complexity: small initial changes reverberate throughout the system, and unfold differently depending on their initial geographic distribution. These scenarios show the value of complexity as a framework for interpreting data and guiding scenario-based planning exercises.},

Simon, the co-founder of publishing giant Simon \& Schuster, her musical debut as half of The Simon Sisters performing folk songs with her sister Lucy in Greenwich Village, to a meteoric solo career that would result in 13 top-40 hits, including the \#1 song "You're So Vain." She was the first artist in history to win a Grammy Award, an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award, for a song composed, written, and performed entirely by a single artist: "Let the River Run" from the movie Working Girl. The memoir recalls a childhood enriched by music and culture, but also one shrouded in secrets that would eventually tear her family apart. Simon captures moments of creative inspiration, the sparks of songs, and the stories behind writing "Anticipation" and "We Have No Secrets" among many others. Romantic entanglements with some of the most famous men of the day fueled her confessional lyrics, as well as the unraveling of her storybook marriage to James Taylor},

  abstract = {We take a decision-theoretic view on the question of how to use instrumental variables and method of moments. Since prior beliefs play an inevitably strong role when instruments are possibly ``weak'', or when the number of instruments is large relative to the number of observations, it is important in these cases to report characteristics of the likelihood beyond the usual IV or ML estimates and their asymptotic (i.e. second-order local) approximate standard errors. IV and GMM appeal because of their legitimate claim to be convenient to compute in many cases, and a (spurious) claim that they can be justified with few ``assumptions''. We discuss some approaches to making such a claim more legitimately.},

The plot of v versus the allosteric activator (AMP) concentration have very complicated shapes: there are several inflection points, and also the maximum at L-threonine concentration equal to 3-10(2) and 5-10(-2) M. High AMP concentrations inhibit the enzyme at high substrate concentrations. The reduced glutathion dose not influence the enzyme and does not alter the activating effect of AMP. On the basis of the data obtained it is proposed that the substrate and AMP shift the equilibrium between multiple oligomeric enzyme forms differing in catalytic activity and kinetic manifestations of allosteric interactions between the active and allosteric AMP-binding sites towards polymerization. Thus, the functioning the enzyme under study is discussed in the frames of the model of dissociating regulatory enzymes with multiple intermediate oligomeric forms.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in remote sensing technology has resulted in peta bytes of data in raster format. This data is often processed in combination with high resolution vector data that represent, for example, city boundaries. One of the common operations that combine big vector and raster data is the zonal statistics which computes some statistics for each polygon in the vector dataset. This paper models the zonal statistics problem as a join problem and propose a novel and distributed system that can scale to peta bytes of raster and vector data. The proposed method does not require any preprocessing or indexing which makes it perfect for ad-hoc queries that scientists usually want to run. We run an extensive experimental evaluation on large scale satellite data with up-to a trillion pixels, and big vector data with up-to hundreds of millions of edges, and we show that our method can perfectly scale to big data with up-to an order of magnitude performance gain. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can scale to bigger datasets than any of the baselines can support.},

Many classifications, including that developed in this paper, are created entirely from data extracted from a single decennial census of population. Such classifications are often criticised as becoming less useful over time because of the changing composition of small geographic areas. This paper presents a methodology for exploring the veracity of this assertion, by examining changes in UK census-based geodemographic indicators over time, as well as a substantive interpretation of the overall results. We present an innovative methodology that classifies both 2001 and 2011 census data inputs utilising a unified geography and set of attributes to create a classification that spans both census periods. Through this classification, we examine the temporal stability of the clusters and whether other secondary data sources and internal measures might usefully indicate local uncertainties in such a classification during an intercensal period.},

Polycentric models fit statistically better than monocentric models, and there was some shift in employment distribution toward a more polycentric pattern.

Empirical theory is a type of ``middlerange theory'' (following Robert Merton): sets of concepts and methods that are less abstract, and have greater empirical content, than high-level social theory. The categories of theory reviewed here include environment-behavior theory, architectural communication theory, space syntax, urban morphology, reception theory, generative planning theory, normative theory, and city size theory. Most of these approaches originated in the fields of architecture, planning, and geography, and they directly link the urban-built environment to the actions of people within cities.},

Therefore, this research study extends the two-dimensional (2D) map comparison methods with the aim to propose a suite of 3D approaches such as 3D Kappa, 3D Fuzzy, and 4D Fuzzy Kappa coefficients specifically designed to perform with voxel data. These proposed approaches can account for fuzziness where small categorical differences in 3D space or space-time are given a degree of similarity instead of a binary similarity value. The developed approaches are tested using different voxel data sets: (a) hypothetical with two and four classes to confirm the methods produce expected results, (b) voxelized LiDAR data to demonstrate the comparison of real 3D data sets, (c) soil horizon voxel data sets to conduct a sensitivity analysis of 3D voxel window sizes, (d) 4D outputs from an agent-based forest-fire smoke model to demonstrate the 4D Fuzzy Kappa coefficient and a sensitivity analysis of 4D voxel window size. The obtained results indicate that 3D and 4D voxel data comparisons are feasible allowing for further work on comparison of 3D data and evaluation of multidimensional models.}

We find that, once the effects of a few readily observed family background characteristics are accounted for, the correlation between neighboring children in their eventual educational attainment is only about 0.1. Given that even this figure is inflated by neighbors' similarity in unmeasured aspects of family background, the results suggest a limited role for neighborhood factors in accounting for inequality in educational attainment.},

PRIZM data reveal that the households moving into gentrified neighborhoods represent a range of lifestyles, calling into question the attribution of ``gentrifier'' to any particular social group or demographic category. In some cases, despite having the same social class positions, gentrifiers pursue varying interests, suggesting they have different effects on neighborhoods. Once lifestyle is accounted for, many assumptions about gentrifiers on which quantitative studies are built become inadequate.

  abstract = {This study uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, in conjunction with neighborhood-level data from the U.S. decennial census and American Community Survey, to examine the trajectory of individuals' neighborhood characteristics from initial household formation into mid-to-late adulthood. Multilevel growth curve models reveal both different starting points and different life course trajectories for blacks and whites in neighborhood economic status and neighborhood racial composition. Among respondents who first established an independent household during the 1970s, improvement in neighborhood income over the adult life course was substantially greater for white than for black respondents; the racial difference in the percentage of neighbors who were non-Hispanic white narrowed slightly with age. Racial differences in the characteristics of neighborhoods inhabited during adolescence help explain racial differences in starting points and, to a lesser extent, subsequent trajectories of neighborhood attainment. Residing in an economically advantaged neighborhood during adolescence confers greater subsequent benefits in neighborhood economic status for white than for black respondents. We use these findings to begin developing a life course perspective on neighborhood attainment.},

  abstract = {Violent crimes are rarely considered a public health problem or investigated using epidemiological methods. But patterns of violent crime and other health conditions are often affected by similar characteristics of the built environment. In this paper, methods and perspectives from spatial epidemiology are used in an analysis of violent crimes in San Antonio, TX. Bayesian statistical methods are used to examine the contextual influence of several aspects of the built environment. Additionally, spatial regression models using Bayesian model specifications are used to examine spatial patterns of violent crime risk. Results indicate that the determinants of violent crime depend on the model specification, but are primarily related to the built environment and neighborhood socioeconomic conditions. Results are discussed within the context of a rapidly growing urban area with a diverse population. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {There is a long cartographic tradition of describing cities through a focus on the characteristics of their residents. A review of the history of this type of urban social analysis highlights some persistent challenges. In this paper existing geodemographic approaches are extended through coupling the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM), a data-mining technique, with geographic information systems (GIS). This approach allows the construction of linked maps of social (attribute) and geographic space. This novel type of geodemographic classification allows ad hoc hierarchical groupings and exploration of the relationship between social similarity and geographic proximity. It allows one to filter complex demographic datasets and is capable of highlighting general social patterns while retaining the fundamental social fingerprints of a city. A dataset describing 79 attributes of the 2217 census tracts in New York City is analyzed to illustrate the technique. Pairs of social and geographic maps are formally compared using simple pattern metrics. Our analysis of New York City calls into question some assumptions about the functional form of spatial relationships that underlie many modeling and statistical techniques. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In 2010 the American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the long form of the United States decennial census. The ACS is now the principal source of high-resolution geographic information about the U.S. population. The margins of error on ACS census tract-level data are on average 75 percent larger than those of the corresponding 2000 long-form estimate. The practical implications of this increase is that data are sometimes so imprecise that they are difficult to use. This paper explains why the ACS tract and block group estimates have large margins of error. Statistical concepts are explained in plain English. ACS margins of error are attributed to specific methodological decisions made by the Census Bureau. These decisions are best seen as compromises that attempt to balance financial constraints against concerns about data quality, timeliness, and geographic precision. In addition, demographic and geographic patterns in ACS data quality are identified. These patterns are associated with demographic composition of census tracts. Understanding the fundamental causes of uncertainty in the survey suggests a number of geographic strategies for improving the usability and quality ACS.},

  abstract = {As noted by theorists such as Blau, Durkheim, Mayhew, and others, interaction opportunity is a fundamental determinant of social structure. One of the most empirically well established factors influencing interaction opportunity is that of physical distance. The strength of this effect in modern societies, however, has been called into question because of technological advances (the so-called death-of-distance hypothesis). Here, the authors examine the effect of distance in an extreme case, considering weak friendship ties among university-affiliated persons in a large-scale online social network. Additionally, the authors explore institutional covariates, such as prestige and public or private status, as moderators of the relationship between distance and social tie probability. The findings demonstrate that geographical distance continues to affect social ties, despite the absence of physical barriers to tie formation and maintenance. The authors find moreover that institutional factors differentially affect the propensity for two university-affiliated individuals to be tied across large distances, illustrating that systematic differences in network structure along status lines persist even in ostensibly unconstrained settings.},

  abstract = {City dashboards have become a common smart city technology, emerging as a key means of sharing and visualising urban data for the benefit of the public and city administrations. Operating as the front-end of many cities' data stores, dashboards display and benchmark indicators relating to city operations, characteristics, and trends, displayed through interactive visual representations of spatial and temporal patterns. Many dashboards collect, archive, and present data collected in real-time, as well as more traditional time-sliced administrative data. In this paper, we evaluate the techniques that dashboards employ to present real-time data to dashboard users. Our analysis identifies two factors that shape and differentiate real-time visual analytic tools: the dynamic nature of the data, how they are refreshed, and how the realtimeness of the data is communicated to the user; and how the tool enables archival comparison. We assess dashboard design according to the strategies used to address specific challenges associated each factor, specifically change blindness and temporal pattern detection. We conclude by proposing effective techniques for city dashboard design.},

Captivatingly written, interwoven with tantalizing illustrations and historical vignettes ranging from Newton's alchemy to quantum mechanics to the storm surge of Hurricane Sandy, Michael Strevens's wholly original investigation of science asks two fundamental questions: Why is science so powerful? And why did it take so long, two thousand years after the invention of philosophy and mathematics, for the human race to start using science to learn the secrets of nature? The Knowledge Machine's radical answer is that science calls on its practitioners to do something irrational: by willfully ignoring religion, theoretical beauty, and, especially, philosophy-essentially stripping away all previous knowledge-scientists embrace an unnaturally narrow method of inquiry, channeling unprecedented energy into observation and experimentation. Like Yuval Harari's Sapiens or Thomas Kuhn's 1962 classic, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, The Knowledge Machine overturns much of what we thought we knew about the origins of the modern world"--},

A few solutions have been proposed, but all of them present some issues in terms of statistical robustness (that is, their capability to generate different matrix configurations with the same probability) and their performance (that is, the computational effort that they require to generate a null matrix). Here we introduce the `Curveball algorithm', a new procedure that differs from existing methods in that it focuses rather on matrix information content than on matrix structure. We demonstrate that the algorithm can sample uniformly the set of all possible matrix configurations requiring a computational effort orders of magnitude lower than that required by available methods, making it possible to easily randomize matrices larger than 108 cells.},

  abstract = {When estimating causal effects using observational data, it is desirable to replicate a randomized experiment as closely as possible by obtaining treated and control groups with similar covariate distributions. This goal can often be achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control groups, thereby reducing bias due to the covariates. Since the 1970's, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine, and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods{\textendash}or developing methods related to matching{\textendash}do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.},

The originality of the study is the focus put on the differences between sequences that are sociologically important when studying life courses such as family life trajectories or professional careers. These differences essentially concern the sequencing (the order in which successive states appear), the timing and the duration of the spells in successive states. The study examines the sensitivity of the measures to these three aspects analytically and empirically by means of simulations. Even if some distance measures underperform, the study shows that there is no universally optimal distance index, and that the choice of a measure depends on which aspect we want to focus on. From the review and simulation results, the paper derives guidelines to help the end user to choose the right dissimilarity measure for her or his research objectives. This study also introduces novel ways of measuring dissimilarities that overcome some flaws in existing measures.},

METHODS We obtained data from various journal search engines and 218 journal articles were downloaded that were relevant to PA and academic performance topics. The abstracts of all the articles were independently peer reviewed to assess whether they met the inclusion criteria for further analysis. The literature search was ongoing. Of the reviewed articles, 9 were chosen on the topic of PA effects on academic behavior. Each article was analyzed and summarized using a standard summary template. RESULTS Overall, PA interventions commonly found positive effects on academic behavior, with few exceptions. There were additional unique findings regarding differences in outcome measures and PA treatments. CONCLUSIONS The findings from these studies are significant and support the implementation or continuation of PA in schools to improve academic behavior and associated performance. More research needs to be conducted using the effective aspects of the treatments from this review with consistent outcome measures.},

In this study, we proposed a framework for assessing China's ecological and economic security, from the perspective of national sustainable development. We also assessed the level and dynamic evolution pattern of the ecological and economic security of different provinces and regions, in terms of the dynamic characteristics of sustainable development. The results indicated that from 2005 to 2019, China's ecosystem sustainability level did not improve significantly, with prominent regional differences; notably, the country would need to deplete its natural capital stock for economic development. As of 2019, China achieved comprehensive and stable high-quality socioeconomic development, but there was a wide gap in the eco-economic efficiency of individual provinces. Currently, the efficiency of the use of natural capital needs improvement. In terms of the ecological and economic security of China's provinces, only the coastal economic zone maintained a safe level of ecological economy, while the rest of the provinces portrayed fluctuations. The convergent evolution of the state revealed that the ecological and economic security portrayed an overall upward trend. However, after considering the neighborhood effect, the ecological and economic security of the northern and southern regions increased, whereas that of the central and coastal regions decreased. This study can serve as a viable framework, to promote sustainable development in not just China, but also other global economies.},

The purpose of this study is to identify types of different land use which influence the spatial distribution of a set of crime types at the intra-urban scale. The originality of the adopted approach lies in its consideration of a large number of different land use types considered as hypothetically influencing the spatial distribution of nine types of common crimes, geocoded at the address-level: car crimes, theft of property-other, residential crimes, property damage, commercial crimes, drug crimes, burglary in other commercial buildings, robbery, and fights and battery. The empirical study covers 31,319 crime events registered by the Police in the years 2006-2010 in the Polish city of Szczecin with a population ca. 405,000. Main research methods used are the GIS tool "multiple ring buffer" and the "crime location quotient (LQC)". The main conclusion from this research is that a strong influence of land use types analyzed is limited to their immediate surroundings (i.e., within a distance of 50 m), with the highest concentration shown by commercial crimes and by the theft of property-other crime type. Land use types strongly attracting crime in this zone are alcohol outlets, clubs and discos, cultural facilities, municipal housing, and commercial buildings. In contrast, grandstands, cemeteries, green areas, allotment gardens, and depots and transport base are land use types strongly detracting crime in this zone.}

Based on a large sample of publicly available Twitter data, our study shows that a substantial share of ties lies within the same metropolitan region, and that between regional clusters, distance, national borders and language differences all predict Twitter ties. We find that the frequency of airline flights between the two parties is the best predictor of Twitter ties. This highlights the importance of looking at pre-existing ties between places and people.},

In this paper, we use the concept of exchange mobility across different time periods to determine the spatial distribution of the theft rate in the city of Wuhan, China, in 2016. To this end, we use a newly-developed spatial dynamic indicator, the Local Indicator of Mobility Association (LIMA), which can detect differences in the spatial distribution of theft rate rankings over time from a distributional dynamics perspective. Our results provide a scientific reference for the evaluation of the effects of crime prevention efforts and offer a decision-making tool to enhance the application of temporal and spatial analytical methods.},

  abstract = {Do neighborhoods ``spread''? American cities are often highly segregated, divided into large regions of blocks with similar ethnic and racial composition with sharp boundaries between them. While most neighborhood research uses fixed boundaries, mostly Census tracts, I argue that boundaries are not predetermined, but emerge endogenously and can move over time. In this dissertation, I ask to what extent, over the last decade, has population change occured by these boundaries moving in space, and to what extent by the overall internal mix of these regions changing? Neighborhood change that occurs by within-cluster change would be large-scale, gradual, and diffuse, whereas change by boundary movements would be sharp, occur to specific blocks, and perhaps continue to segregate residents' use of space. In Chapter 1, I develop a Bayesian algorithm, the Space-Time Chinese Restaurant Process (Space-Time CRP), to identify these spatial clusters of households' race and ethnicity from block-level Census data, with boundaries that can move over time. I examine the changes in those ethnoracial clusters in Philadelphia, PA from 2000 to 2010, and decompose Philadelphia's ethnoracial change to find a previously unmeasured dynamic: more-White and Asian clusters are growing spatially, even as all clusters are internally becoming more Black and more Hispanic. In Chapter 2, I replicate the analysis for the 100 largest U.S. central cities. In most of the cities, the overall trend was one of internal changes, led by increasing proportions Hispanic and Asian. However, I find that population change by boundary movement was prevalent in denser cities, and usually by Whiter clusters expanding into Blacker clusters. While all cities experienced gradual increases in non-White populations within clusters, the gentrification of dense cities occured by the sharper change of Whiter clusters expanding. In Chapter 3, I measure the change in number and type of businesses as a boundary moves. Businesses are a compelling symbol and perhaps agent of neighborhood change. I find that business change is typically a lagging indicator around gentrifying boundaries, with businesses changing only after the demographic change has occured. In neighborhoods experiencing increasing non-White populations, businesses change in advance of the boundary's approach.},

  abstract = {Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) are a class of spatial statistical methods that have been widely applied in various scientific fields. When applying LISA to make longitudinal comparisons of spatial data, a common way is to run LISA analysis at each time point, then compare the results to infer the distributional dynamics of spatial processes. Given that LISA hinges on the global mean value that often varies across time, the LISA result generated at time Ti reflects the spatial patterns strictly with respect to Ti. Therefore, the typical comparative cross-sectional analysis with LISA can only characterize the relative distributional dynamics. However, the relative perspective alone is inadequate to comprehend the full picture, as the patterns are not directly associated with the changes of the spatial process's intensity. We argue that it is important to obtain the absolute distribution dynamics to complement the relative perspective, especially for tracking how spatial processes evolve across time at the local level. We develop a solution that modifies the significance test when implementing LISA analysis of longitudinal data to reveal and visualize the absolute distribution dynamics. Experiments were conducted with Mongolian livestock data and Rwanda population data.},

In this chapter, we present a tactical dashboard assembled to provide real-time information to citizens being impacted by extreme weather events. The dashboard is tactical as it is assembled ``just in time'' for the arrival of Cyclone Debbie, which impacted the East Coast of Australia in 2017. The chapter provides a review of available crisis dashboards, introduces the tactical Cyclone Dashboard (www.cyclonedashboard.com.au), discusses its technical components and provides the results of its preliminary evaluation. We conclude by reflecting on the value of such dashboards for providing real-time information to citizens during natural disasters.},

  abstract = {Background: Numerous studies have found that areas with higher alcohol establishment density are more likely to have higher violent crime rates, but many of these studies did not assess the differential effects of type of establishments or the effects on multiple categories of crime. In this study, we assess whether alcohol establishment density is associated with 4 categories of violent crime and whether the strength of the associations varies by type of violent crime and by on-premise establishments (e.g., bars, restaurants) versus off-premise establishments (e.g., liquor and convenience stores). Methods: Data come from the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2009 and were aggregated and analyzed at the neighborhood level. Across the 83 neighborhoods in Minneapolis, we examined 4 categories of violent crime: assault, rape, robbery, and total violent crime. We used a Bayesian hierarchical inference approach to model the data, accounting for spatial auto-correlation and controlling for relevant neighborhood demographics. Models were estimated for total alcohol establishment density as well as separately for on-premise establishments and off-premise establishments. Results: Positive, statistically significant associations were observed for total alcohol establishment density and each of the violent crime outcomes. We estimate that a 3.9 to 4.3\% increase across crime categories would result from a 20\% increase in neighborhood establishment density. The associations between on-premise density and each of the individual violent crime outcomes were also all positive and significant and similar in strength as for total establishment density. The relationships between off-premise density and the crime outcomes were all positive but not significant for rape or total violent crime, and the strength of the associations was weaker than those for total and on-premise density. Conclusions: Results of this study, combined with earlier findings, provide more evidence that community leaders should be cautious about increasing the density of alcohol establishments within their neighborhoods. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.},

Agents are more likely to be employed if their social contacts are also employed. The model generates a stationary distribution of unemployment that exhibits positive spatial correlations. I estimate the model via an indirect inference procedure, using Census Tract data for Chicago. I find a significantly positive amount of social interactions across neighbouring tracts. The local spillovers are stronger for areas with less educated workers and higher fractions of minorities. Furthermore, they are shaped by ethnic dividing lines and neighbourhood boundaries.},

This study used a developmental-ecological framework to investigate the influence of neighborhood, family, and peer contexts on alcohol use in early adolescence (N = 387). Results from a multi-informant longitudinal cross-lagged mediation path model suggested that high levels of neighborhood disadvantage were associated with high levels of alcohol use 2 years later via an indirect pathway that included exposure to delinquent peers and adolescent delinquency. Results also indicated that adolescent involvement with delinquent peers and alcohol use led to decrements in parenting, rather than being consequences of poor parenting. Overall, the study supported hypothesized relationships among key microsystems thought to influence adolescent alcohol use, and thus findings underscore the utility of developmental-ecological models of alcohol use},

  abstract = {This article examines the significance of outlying groups in the spatial organization of Classic Maya settlements. The relative scarcity of textual records concerning outlying groups has often made it difficult for researchers to analyze in detail the political interactions between individuals associated with these groups and the royal authority. The recent discovery of a hieroglyphic stairway at the Guzm{\'a}n Group, an outlying group of El Palmar, Campeche, Mexico, provides an exceptional opportunity for understanding the constitutive process of spatial organization during the Late and Terminal Classic periods (ca. A.D. 600-900). Epigraphic studies of the Guzm{\'a}n Group stairway have identified a main individual who emphasized his genealogical ties to lakam (banner-bearer) officials and his political relationship with foreign rulers of Cop{\'a}n and Calakmul. The results of archaeological and epigraphic studies suggest that the Guzm{\'a}n Group was a locus for negotiating power and ideology among different social actors.           ,              Resumen             En el presente art{\'i}culo se examina el proceso de formac{\'i}on de los grupos arquitect{\'o}nicos apartados de los n{\'u}cleos urbanos en la organizaci{\'o}n espacial de las entidades pol{\'i}ticas mayas durante el per{\'i}odo Cl{\'a}sico (ca. 250-900 d.C). La escasez de estos grupos discretos con registros epigr{\'a}ficos que mencionen a lospersonajes que los habitaron ha limitado el conocimiento sobre la interacti{\'o}n pol{\'i}tico entre dichos adores con la autoridad real. El reciente descubrimiento de una escalinata jeroglifica en un grupo discreto designado como Grupo Guzm{\'a}n, ubicado 1,3 km al norte del sitio arqueol{\'o}gico de El Palmar, ofrece una excelente oportunidad para entender el proceso constitutive de la organizaci{\'o}n espacial de esta entidad pol{\'i}tica maya durante el Cl{\'a}sico Tard{\'i}o y Terminal (ca. 600-900 d.C). En los textos epigr{\'a}ficos de la escalinata se identific{\'o} un protagonista que enfatiza su v{\'i}nculo geneal{\'o}gico con oficiales que poseen el t{\'i}tulo de lakam (abanderado) y sus nexos pol{\'i}ticos con gobernantes de Cop{\'a}n y Calakmul.

Geographers appear to be confident of both the meaning of space and the methods suited to its analysis. The interpretation of spatial elements requires an abstract and objective frame of thought, quantifiable data, and ideally the language of mathematics. Place, like space, lies at the core of geographical discipline. Indeed an Ad Hoc Committee of American geographers (1965, 7) asserted that ``the modern science of geography derives its substance from man's sense of place''. In the geographical literature, place has been given several meanings (Lukermann, 1964; May, 1970). As location, place is one unit among other units to which it is linked by a circulation net; the analysis of location is subsumed under the geographer's concept and analysis of space. Place, however, has more substance than the word location suggests: it is a unique entity, a `special ensemble' (Lukermann, 1964, p. 70); it has a history and meaning. Place incarnates the experiences and aspirations of a people. Place is not only a fact to be explained in the broader frame of space, but it is also a reality to be clarified and understood from the perspectives of the people who have given it meaning.},

In 2021, for example, one widely publicized report argued that "The world's rapidly growing population is consuming the planet's natural resources at an alarming rate . . . the world currently needs 1.6 Earths to satisfy the demand for natural resources ... a figure that could rise to 2 planets by 2030." But is that true? After analyzing the prices of hundreds of commodities, goods, and services spanning two centuries, Marian Tupy and Gale Pooley found that resources became more abundant as the population grew. That was especially true when they looked at "time prices," which represent the length of time that people must work to buy something. To their surprise, the authors also found that resource abundance increased faster than the population, a relationship that they call superabundance. On average, every additional human being created more value than he or she consumed. This relationship between population growth and abundance is deeply counterintuitive, yet it is true. Why? More people produce more ideas, which lead to more inventions. People then test those inventions in the marketplace to separate the useful from the useless. At the end of that process of discovery, people are left with innovations that overcome shortages, spur economic growth, and raise standards of living. But large populations are not enough to sustain superabundance; just think of the poverty in China and India before their respective economic reforms. To innovate, people must be allowed to think, speak, publish, associate, and disagree. They must be allowed to save, invest, trade, and profit. In a word, they must be free"--},

  abstract = {Data from approximately 140 articles and reports published since 2000 on drinking, alcohol use disorder (AUD), correlates of drinking and AUD, and treatment needs, access, and utilization were critically examined and summarized. Epidemiological evidence demonstrates alcohol-related disparities across U.S. racial/ethnic groups. American Indians/Alaska Natives generally drink more and are disproportionately affected by alcohol problems, having some of the highest rates for AUD. In contrast, Asian Americans are less affected. Differences across Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics are more nuanced. The diversity in drinking and problem rates that is observed across groups also exists within groups, particularly among Hispanics, Asian Americans, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. Research findings also suggest that acculturation to the United States and nativity affect drinking. Recent studies on ethnic drinking cultures uncover the possible influence that native countries' cultural norms around consumption still have on immigrants' alcohol use. The reasons for racial/ethnic disparities in drinking and AUD are complex and are associated with historically rooted patterns of racial discrimination and persistent socioeconomic disadvantage. This disadvantage is present at both individual and environmental levels. Finally, these data indicate that admission to alcohol treatment is also complex and is dependent on the presence and severity of alcohol problems but also on a variety of other factors. These include individuals' sociodemographic characteristics, the availability of appropriate services, factors that may trigger coercion into treatment by family, friends, employers, and the legal system, and the overall organization of the treatment system. More research is needed to understand facilitators and barriers to treatment to improve access to services and support. Additional directions for future research are discussed.},

Numb with grief yet longing for insight into her husband's mind, Clare goes to the film Richard believed would be groundbreaking. And, in a way, it is. The next day she sees Richard standing outside the Museum of Revolution. He is wearing a white linen suit and he is supposed to be dead. As Clare follows Richard through the newly tourist-filled streets and charts the course of her less-than-perfect marriage, the distance between reality and fantasy blurs, forcing her to consider what is real and what is not},

Interaction and effect modification are formally defined within the counterfactual framework. Interaction is defined in terms of the effects of 2 interventions whereas effect modification is defined in terms of the effect of one intervention varying across strata of a second variable. Effect modification can be present with no interaction; interaction can be present with no effect modification. There are settings in which it is possible to assess effect modification but not interaction, or to assess interaction but not effect modification. The analytic procedures for obtaining estimates of effect modification parameters and interaction parameters using marginal structural models are compared and contrasted. A characterization is given of the settings in which interaction and effect modification coincide.},

If we could not measure then we could not observe the world around us; we could not experiment, learn, and co-operate. But why did this urge to measure flourish? And when did measurement become ubiquitous? It is an incredible story that spans hunter-gatherer societies to ancient Egyptians, the French Revolution to the relentless quantification of the twenty-first century self. It is a tale that tracks humanity's search for dependable truths in a chaotic universe. Full of mavericks and visionaries, adventure and breakthroughs, Beyond Measure shows that measurement has not only made the world we live in, it has made us too},

Three issues will be addressed here. Firstly, how is the spatial dispersion of personal networks related to individuals' social characteristics, network composition and residential mobility? Secondly, how do the spatial dispersion of networks, residential mobility and their combined effect influence the number and (thirdly) the structure of emotional support ties? Results showed that the extent of the support was affected neither by the geographical distribution of the networks nor by residential mobility. Living far from one's birthplace, however, exerted two distinct, and opposite effects on the support network structure. On the one hand, mobility led to high spatial dispersion of personal contacts, which in turn favored a sparsely knit network centered around the mobile individual. On the other hand, by controlling for the effect of distance between the contacts, we found that individuals that cited long-distance ties tended to be part of more transitive support networks than those that cited local ties. We interpreted the latter effect as evidence that transitive ties may survive greater spatial distances than intransitive ones. These findings are discussed in view of spatial mobility and social network research.},

  abstract = {Most cancers in humans are large, measuring centimetres in diameter, and composed of many billions of cells. An equivalent mass of normal cells would be highly heterogeneous as a result of the mutations that occur during each cell division. What is remarkable about cancers is that virtually every neoplastic cell within a large tumour often contains the same core set of genetic alterations, with heterogeneity confined to mutations that emerge late during tumour growth{\textendash}. How such alterations expand within the spatially constrained three-dimensional architecture of a tumour, and come to dominate a large, pre-existing lesion, has been unclear. Here we describe a model for tumour evolution that shows how short-range dispersal and cell turnover can account for rapid cell mixing inside the tumour. We show that even a small selective advantage of a single cell within a large tumour allows the descendants of that cell to replace the precursor mass in a clinically relevant time frame. We also demonstrate that the same mechanisms can be responsible for the rapid onset of resistance to chemotherapy. Our model not only provides insights into spatial and temporal aspects of tumour growth, but also suggests that targeting short-range cellular migratory activity could have marked effects on tumour growth rates.},

  abstract = {Racial and ethnic diversity in the United States is on the rise, as the country is projected to no longer have a racial majority by the mid-2040s. Much of this diversity is found in the United States' large metropolitan areas, where it manifests itself unevenly. While some metropolitan neighbourhoods are growing highly diverse, others remain segregated by race and ethnicity. This paper introduces a framework for exploring the geography of neighbourhood diversity in US metropolitan areas, and defines the diversity gradient, a visual representation of how diversity varies with distance from the urban core. Analysis of the geography of metropolitan diversity from 1990 to 2010 reveals that the greatest increases in diversity are found in the suburbs and outlying areas, where diversity now peaks in many large metropolitan areas. Additional spatial analyses of neighbourhood diversity in Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth show that clustering of highly diverse neighbourhoods has shifted to the suburbs from close-in urban areas, where many segregated and low-diversity neighbourhoods persist.},

These results, coupled with measurements of spatial correlation, reveal the importance of spatial analysis in the study of the interaction of alcohol and violence. While studies increasingly incorporate spatial correlation among model residuals to improve precision and reduce bias, to date, most analyses assume associations that are constant and independent of location, an assumption coming under increasing scrutiny in the quantitative geography literature. In this paper, we review and contrast two approaches for the estimation of and inference for spatially heterogeneous effects (i.e., associative factors whose impacts on the outcome of interest vary throughout geographic space). Specifically, we provide an in-depth comparison of 'geographically weighted regression' models (allowing covariate effects to vary in space but only allowing relatively ad hoc inference) with 'variable coefficient' models (allowing varying effects via spatial random fields and providing model-based estimation and inference, but requiring more advanced computational techniques). We compare the approaches with respect to underlying conceptual structures, computational implementation, and inferential output. We apply both approaches to violent crime, illegal drug arrest, and alcohol distribution data from Houston, Texas and compare results in light of the differing methodological structures of the two approaches. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.}

To explore the role of distance in the information age, three methods {\textendash} web scan, hyperlink, and trace-route {\textendash} are used to map the Internet for the US educational network. Statistical analysis is conducted to evaluate whether physical distance has any impact on the Internet information access. The cartographic and statistical results indicate that geography in general and distance in particular are still important factors in shaping the spatial pattern of Internet activities. For the most popular fifty-three US educational web sites, the physical distance within one thousand miles has positive effects on Internet access while access to international hosts heavily depends on the response time, link speed and other Internet infrastructures and interconnections such as the availability of domain name servers, network access points, backbones, etc. Implications of absolute, relative, and virtual distance in mapping the Internet are discussed. It is concluded that the death of distance hypothesis is premature, even misguided in most cases.},

This article contributes a new empirical study to the debate of ``death of distance'' by considering the effect of spatial autocorrelation in the estimation of distance decay effect with the incorporation of network autocorrelation in spatial econometric modeling. This work is based on a citylevel dataset from China's largest social networking site called Weibo. The findings are shown as following. First, the coefficient value of network autocorrelation term (0.007, significant at 0.01 level) suggests that the city-level online social links are spatially dependent. In other words, these social connections are not randomly distributed across space but tend to form spatial clusters where neighboring links are more similar. Second, controlling spatial autocorrelation in the data, a distance decay effect on the formation of online social links is unveiled with a much smaller scaling exponent of the distances (i.e., 0.276) as compared to those (e.g., 2.0, 1.8, 1.45, 1.06, 1.03, 0.4, and 0.5) in existing studies. This research provides a useful modeling framework to analyze the realworld driving forces that characterize the patterns of social interactions in virtual space and thus advance our understanding in the connection of virtual and real spaces.},

However, current clustering research emphasizes the development of more efficient and effective clustering methods without paying much attention to domain knowledge and users' goals during the clustering process. Making better use of geospatial and clustering knowledge to select proper methods and datasets will help achieve clustering results that better meet users' requirements. In this article, we present the GEO\_CLUST framework for performing geospatial clustering. The framework consists of the GeoCO ontology for geospatial clustering and the ontology reasoner reasoning mechanism. The GeoCO ontology is used to represent geospatial and clustering domain knowledge. The ontology reasoner uses classification and decomposition techniques to specify users' tasks. Using the framework, users can identify the appropriate geospatial data and clustering method based on their specific goals. To demonstrate the framework, two case studies on finding population density clusters in Western Canada and locating five hospitals in South Carolina are discussed. The results show that the framework can select the proper datasets and clustering methods with respect to users' goals.},

Our research advances this line of work by developing a simulation-based statistical test for the local indicator of colocation quotient (LCLQ). The study applies the indicator to examine the association of land use facilities with crime patterns. Moreover, we use the street network distance in addition to the traditional Euclidean distance in defining neighbors because human activities (including facilities and crimes) usually occur along a street network. The method is applied to analyze the colocation of three types of crimes and three categories of facilities in a city in Jiangsu Province, China. The findings demonstrate the value of the proposed method in colocation analysis of crime and facilities and, in general, colocation analysis of point data.}

We develop a test of neighborhood isolation that improves on static measures derived from commonly used census reports by leveraging fine-grained dynamic data on the everyday movement of residents in America's 50 largest cities. We analyze 650 million geocoded Twitter messages to estimate the home locations and travel patterns of almost 400,000 residents over 18 mo. We find surprisingly high consistency across neighborhoods of different race and income characteristics in the average travel distance (radius) and number of neighborhoods traveled to (spread) in the metropolitan region; however, we uncover notable differences in the composition of the neighborhoods visited. Residents of primarily black and Hispanic neighborhoods-whether poor or not-are far less exposed to either nonpoor or white middle-class neighborhoods than residents of primarily white neighborhoods. These large racial differences are notable given recent declines in segregation and the increasing diversity of American cities. We also find that white poor neighborhoods are substantially isolated from nonpoor white neighborhoods. The results suggest that even though residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods travel far and wide, their relative isolation and segregation persist.},

The results show that existing stations have a greater impact on urban spatial expansion. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000732. {\textcopyright} 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

  abstract = {Earth Observation (EO)-based mapping of cities has great potential to detect patterns beyond the physical ones. However, EO combined with the surge of machine learning techniques to map non-physical, such as socioeconomic, aspects directly, goes to the expense of reproducibility and interpretability, hence scientific validity. In this paper, we suggest shifting the focus from the direct detection of socioeconomic status from raw images through image features, to the mapping of interpretable urban morphology of basic urban elements as an intermediate step, to which socioeconomic patterns can then be related. This shift is profound, in that, rather than abstract image features, it allows to capture the morphology of real urban objects, such as buildings and streets, and use this to then interpret other patterns, including socioeconomic ones. Because socioeconomic patterns are not derived from raw image data, the mapping of these patterns is less data demanding and more replicable. Specifically, we propose a 2-step approach: (1) extraction of fundamental urban elements from satellite imagery, and (2) derivation of meaningful urban morphological patterns from the extracted elements. We refer to this 2-step approach as ``EO~+~Morphometrics''. Technically, EO consists of applying deep learning through a reengineered U-Net shaped convolutional neural network to publicly accessible Google Earth imagery for building extraction. Methods of urban morphometrics are then applied to these buildings to compute semantically explicit and interpretable metrics of urban form. Finally, clustering is applied to these metrics to obtain morphological patterns, or urban types. The ``EO~+~Morphometrics'' approach is applied to the city of Nairobi, Kenya, where 15 different urban types are identified. To test whether this outcome meaningfully describes current urbanization patterns, we verified whether selected types matched locally designated informal settlements. We observe that four urban types, characterized by compact and organic urban form, were recurrent in such settlements. The proposed ``EO~+~Morphometrics'' approach paves the way for the large-scale identification of interpretable urban form patterns and study of associated dynamics across any region in the world.},

  abstract = {Spatial regression is widely used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and explanatory covariates. Oftentimes, the linear relationships vary across space, such that some covariates have location-specific effects on the response. One fundamental question is how to detect the systematic variation in the model and identify which locations share common regression coefficients and which do not. Only a correct model structure can assure unbiased estimation of coefficients and valid inferences. A new procedure is proposed, called Spatial Heterogeneity Automatic Detection and Estimation (SHADE), for automatically and simultaneously subgrouping and estimating covariate effects for spatial regression models. The SHADE employs a class of spatially-weighted fusion type penalty on all pairs of observations, with location-specific weight constructed using spatial information, to cluster coefficients into subgroups. Under certain regularity conditions, the SHADE is shown to be able to identify the true model structure with probability approaching one and estimate regression coefficients consistently. An alternating direction method of multiplier algorithm (ADMM) is developed to compute the SHADE. In numerical studies, the empirical performance of the SHADE is demonstrated by using different choices of weights and comparing their accuracy. The results suggest that spatial information can enhance subgroup structure analysis in challenging situations when the spatial variation among regression coefficients is small or the number of repeated measures is small. Finally, the SHADE is applied to find the relationship between a natural resource survey and a land cover data layer to identify spatially interpretable groups.},

This paper presents methods to analyze convergence in cross-sectional data collected over time using distribution free statistics that are not sensitive to the magnitudes involved. Measures of concordance and discordance are employed in the empirical analysis of real personal income per capita for 48 U.S. States over the period 1929{\textendash}2002. Although most States are converging with each other, some are converging faster than others. The methods used have the flexibility to focus on specific characteristics such as convergence in absolute differences or convergence in the ratio of rewards. The methods may also be used to consider convergence without switching and additionally be applied to other features such as the percentiles of the distributions.},

  abstract = {Demographic and socio-economic information provided by the American Community Survey (ACS) have been increasingly relied upon in many planning and decision making contexts due to its timely and current estimates. However, ACS estimates are well known to be subject to larger sampling errors with a much smaller sample size compared with the decennial census data. To support the assessment of the reliability of ACS estimates, the US Census Bureau publishes a margin of error at the 90\% confidence level alongside each estimate. While data error or uncertainty in ACS estimates has been widely acknowledged, little has been done to devise methods accounting for such error or uncertainty. This article focuses on addressing ACS data uncertainty issues in choropleth mapping, one of the most widely used methods to visually explore spatial distributions of demographic and socio-economic data. A new classification method is developed to explicitly integrate errors of estimation in the assessment of within-class variation and the associated groupings. The proposed method is applied to mapping the 2009{\textendash}2013 ACS estimates of median household income at various scales. Results are compared with those generated using existing classification methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new classification scheme.},

However, a new form of development based on Alibaba Group's Taobao e-commerce platform, known as Taobao villages, has emerged in rural China to capitalize from e- commerce and sustain rural development. We investigate development trajectories and organizational structure of Taobao villages to better understand e-commerce and regional development in rural China, including the role of entrepreneurs, firms, and local states. We find that Taobao villages are being produced through economic restructuring and institutional change in response to shifting economic contexts. We have identified five development models of Taobao villages: production-oriented Xishan, Qiaoyun and Bainiu models, and market-oriented Beishan and Qingyanliu models. We also find that local states and ICT (information and communication technology) firms have played an important role in facilitating the development of Taobao villages. Taobao villages have to work closely with their local and external networks to upgrade technology, enhance innovation, and increase added value. Local contexts and spatial networking are essential to the development of Taobao villages. As a new form of regional development, Taobao villages may provide a pathway to economic development for rural areas in other developing countries.},

  abstract = {Alcohol-related violence remains a serious social and public health problem in the United States. A large corpus of work suggests a positive statistical relationship between alcohol outlet density and violence. However, questions remain as to how neighborhood violence evolves in response to varying access to alcohol outlets. This paper introduces an approach for analyzing the spatial and temporal dynamics of violence and its association with alcohol outlets by embedding the evolution of assault events and outlet density within a spatially heterogeneous Markov chain framework. This framework enables the exploration of spatiotemporal dynamics of alcohol outlets and violence and controls for potentially confounding impacts and spatial heterogeneity. Using a case study at the block group level in Seattle, Washington, the results of this paper suggest that violence is spatially heterogeneous at the local level and locations with sparsely distributed alcohol outlets are less likely to see an increase in violence when compared to areas with higher densities of outlets. Further, the modeling approach helps identify locations that might ``tip'' into more violent conditions if more outlets were allowed to operate. This paper concludes with a brief discussion of how the methods and results can help improve the management, licensing, and policy development for alcohol outlets in a community.},

  abstract = {Racial segregation in public education has been declared as unconstitutional for over 60 years in the United States. Yet many public school districts remain largely separate and unequal. A commonly used approach to reduce school segregation is redelineating school attendance zones to create more racially diverse classrooms. However, there is a need for a school districting approach that can minimize racial or socioeconomic segregation at the district level. In this paper, we develop a spatial optimization model that delineates school attendance zones with the aim of minimizing racial segregation of school district to enable the assessment of the impacts of school attendance zones on the racial segregation of school district. Applications of this model to Riverside Unified School District (RUSD) and San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) in California, USA show that it is possible to reduce racial segregation by 64\% at RUSD and 56\% at SDUSD, demonstrating the potential of the proposed model.},

We compare experimental measurements of the average fraction, correlation functions between strains, and the relative rates of genetic domain wall annihilations and coalescences to simulations modeling the population as a one-dimensional ring of annihilating and coalescing random walkers with deterministic biases due to selection. The simulations reveal that the evolutionary dynamics can be collapsed onto master curves governed by three essential parameters: (1) an expansion length beyond which selection dominates over genetic drift; (2) a characteristic angular correlation describing the size of genetic domains; and (3) a dimensionless constant quantifying the interplay between a colony's curvature at the frontier and its selection length scale. We measure these parameters with a new technique that precisely measures small selective differences between spatially competing strains and show that our simulations accurately predict the dynamics with no additional fitting. Our results suggest that that the random walk model can act as a useful predictive tool when describing the evolutionary dynamics of range expansions composed of an arbitrary number of competing alleles with different fitnesses.},

In addition, we focus on the inherent coefficient shrinkage properties of the Bayesian SVCP model as a way to address increased coefficient variance that follows from collinearity in GWR models. We outline the advantages of the Bayesian model in terms of reducing inflated coefficient variance, enhanced model flexibility, and more formal measuring of model uncertainty for prediction. We find spatially varying effects for alcohol outlets and drug violations, but the amount of variation depends on the type of model used. For the Bayesian model, this variation is controllable through the amount of prior influence placed on the variance of the coefficients. For example, the spatial pattern of coefficients is similar for the GWR and Bayesian models when a relatively large prior variance is used in the Bayesian model. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological data relating to all 202 patients diagnosed with Burkitt's Lymphoma (BL) in the West Nile District of Uganda in the period 1961 to 1975 have been reviewed and analysed. Statistically significant evidence of space-time clustering of cases, first reported for the period 1961-65, was also present during 1972-73, but not during other periods. The patients involved in such clusters were found to be older than other patients (P less than 0.001). The average annual incidence of BL in the District was 2.45 x 10(-5) and overall there was no change in the incidence during the study period. However, there were statistically significant changes in incidence in different counties, which could not be explained as case-ascertainment artifacts. One sib pair of patients with BL was found and the series also included 7 instances of BL in two cousins. It is suggested that study of variation in the intensity and type of malarial infestation in different areas at different times may help explain the epidemiological findings and suggest what, if any, aspects of this infection are critical for inducing BL.},

  abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has become essential for biomedical research over the past decade, particularly in developmental biology, cancer, immunology, and neuroscience. Most commercially available scRNA-seq protocols require cells to be recovered intact and viable from tissue. This has precluded many cell types from study and largely destroys the spatial context that could otherwise inform analyses of cell identity and function. An increasing number of commercially available platforms now facilitate spatially resolved, high-dimensional assessment of gene transcription, known as `spatial transcriptomics'. Here, we introduce different classes of method, which either record the locations of hybridized mRNA molecules in tissue, image the positions of cells themselves prior to assessment, or employ spatial arrays of mRNA probes of pre-determined location. We review sizes of tissue area that can be assessed, their spatial resolution, and the number and types of genes that can be profiled. We discuss if tissue preservation influences choice of platform, and provide guidance on whether specific platforms may be better suited to discovery screens or hypothesis testing. Finally, we introduce bioinformatic methods for analysing spatial transcriptomic data, including pre-processing, integration with existing scRNA-seq data, and inference of cell-cell interactions. Spatial -omics methods are already improving our understanding of human tissues in research, diagnostic, and therapeutic settings. To build upon these recent advancements, we provide entry-level guidance for those seeking to employ spatial transcriptomics in their own biomedical research.},

With an increasingly large number of studies on urban place detection in language, behavior, pricing, and demography, recent critiques of longstanding regional science perspectives on place detection have focused on the arbitrariness and non-geographical nature of measures of best fit. In this paper, we develop new explicitly geographical measures of cluster fit. These hybrid spatial{\textendash}social measures, called geosilhouettes, are demonstrated to capture the ``core'' of geographical clusters in racial data on census blocks in Brooklyn neighborhoods. These new geosilhouettes are also useful in a variety of boundary analysis and outlier detection problems. In this paper, the thinking behind geosilhouettes is presented, their mathematical form is defined, they are demonstrated, and new directions of research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Clustering is a central concern in geographic data science and reflects a large, active domain of research. In spatial clustering, it is often challenging to balance two kinds of `goodness of fit:' clusters should have `feature' homogeneity, in that they aim to represent one `type' of observation, and also `geographic' coherence, in that they aim to represent some detected geographical `place'. This divides `map typologization' studies, common in geodemographics, from `regionalization' studies, common in spatial optimization and statistics. Recent attempts to simultaneously typologize and regionalize data into clusters with both feature homogeneity and geographic coherence have faced conceptual and computational challenges. Fortunately, new work on spectral clustering can address both regionalization and typologization tasks within the same framework. This research develops a novel kernel combination method for use within spectral clustering that allows analysts to blend smoothly between feature homogeneity and geographic coherence. I explore the formal properties of two kernel combination methods and recommend multiplicative kernel combination with spectral clustering. Altogether, spatially encouraged spectral clustering is shown as a novel kernel combination clustering method that can address both regionalization and typologization tasks in order to reveal the geographies latent in spatially structured data.},

This paper proposes a framework, which decomposes segregation attributable to different geographical levels, to conceptually link segregation values obtained from multiple geographical levels together such that differences in segregation values among levels are accounted for. Using two different indices, the dissimilarity index D and the diversity index H, this paper illustrates the decomposition methods specific to these indices. When these indices are decomposed, local measures of segregation pertaining to multiple geographical levels are computed. These local segregation measures indicate the levels of segregation contributed by the local units and the regional units to the entire study area.},

Using spatially aggregated data to evaluate segregation in the residential space has been the norm and thus individual's segregation experiences in other socio-geographical spaces are often de-emphasized or ignored. This paper attempts to provide a more comprehensive approach in evaluating segregation beyond the residential space. The entire activity spaces of individuals are taken into account with individuals serving as the building blocks of the analysis. The measurement principle is based upon the exposure dimension of segregation. The proposed measure reflects the exposure of individuals of a referenced group in a neighborhood to the populations of other groups that are found within the activity spaces of individuals in the referenced group. Using the travel diary data collected from the tri-county area in southeast Florida and the imputed racial-ethnic data, this paper demonstrates how the proposed segregation measurement approach goes beyond just measuring population distribution patterns in the residential space and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of segregation by considering various socio-geographical spaces.},

The problem is called ``the modifiable areal unit'' because the boundaries of many geographical units are often demarcated artificially, and thus can be changed. For example, administrative boundaries, political districts, and census enumeration units are all subject to be redrawn. When data are gathered according to different boundary definitions, different data sets are generated. Analyzing these data sets will likely provide inconsistent results. This is the essence of the MAUP.},

In 1910, Baltimore was the first city to adopt an ordinance banning African Americans from white neighborhoods. In part, this law was justified as a means to restrain the violent behavior of white citizens who might otherwise act as vigilantes against their black neighbors. Other cities followed suit. These racial zones were declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. However, for 31 years this Court sanctioned the adoption of private restrictive covenants that were effective at blocking African Americans from buying or renting a house in a white neighborhood. In the 1930s, the insertion of racially restrictive covenants became both a protective mechanism and a prerequisite for federal mortgage lending, insurance, and guarantees by a variety of national housing agencies. In effect, the federal government enforced racial segregation even though local governments were not allowed to. The net effect of three decades of federal housing programs was to drive an economic wedge between federally subsidized housing for whites and federally enforced denial of housing loans in African American neighborhoods. Those policies made whites wealthy at the expense of African Americans, a condition that still persists and will continue to do so in the absence of federal intervention to reverse the wealth gap it helped to create.},

The cloud cover data were derived from two Landsat images on a relatively clear day and a relatively cloudy day, respectively. In these models, the response variable was binary with 0 representing non-cloudy areas and 1 representing cloudy areas. The covariates included slope, aspect, and the difference between elevation and lifting condensation level. The results indicated that the spatial LMM did not improve the prediction of probability of cloud cover over the non-spatial LRM. One possible explanation is that the LMM was not able to account for the anisotropy in the non-spatial LRM residuals. In contrast, the GWLM with the bandwidth close to the effective range of the semivariogram of the LRM residuals showed the best model fitting among the three types of models, resulting in the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and sum of squared errors (SSE), and the smallest spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity in the model residuals. The GWLM model coefficients were spatially nonstationary, ranging from negative to positive depending on locations. The significance of the covariates also varied spatially. Our study demonstrated that GWLM is a useful and effective tool to account for spatial heterogeneity in modeling/predicting the occurrence or probability of cloud cover, using the spatial data derived from satellite imagery and GIS.},

With increased globalization and economic transition, a dramatic industrial restructuring has been taking place in China. Applying geographically weighted shift-share model (GW-SSM) and geographically and temporally weighted regression model (GTWR), we analyze (re)location dynamics and determinants of the manufacturing industry in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) from 1999 to 2013, with particular attention to the implications of economic transition and institutional restructuring. We find that high-tech and capital-intensive manufacturing industries agglomerated in coastal cities, while labor-intensive and resource-based sectors have become spatially more dispersed to peripheral areas. We also find that the development of service and high-tech industries, rising labor costs, and more strict environmental regulations have facilitated the geographic dispersion of labor- and pollution-intensive industries. Moreover, regions with advantages in intermediate goods, preferential policies, and urbanization economies are attractive to capital- and technology-intensive manufacturing industries. Our research suggests that development policies should be tailored to specific regions to promote local production and innovative networks and make manufacturing industries more competitive.},

The results find the co-existence of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH) and the Porter Hypothesis (PH) at an industrial level. PIIs, especially the labor-intensive PIIs, become geographically more dispersed to the peripheral YRD, while capital-, tax- and technology-intensive PIIs are still highly concentrated in the core YRD. Uneven environmental regulations (ERs), such as pollutant emission controls and government supervision, have directly reshaped the spatial patterns of PIIs. The modelling results also suggest that regional differences in factor endowment, ecosystem, and upgrading and innovation milieu play an important role in PIIs (re)distribution, and PIIs with diverse industrial characteristics respond differently to the changes in ERs and other place-specific attributes. Relatively loose ERs, low production cost, and high environmental bearing-capacity can promote the formation of ``pollution havens'' for labor-intensive or low-end PIIs. However, local assets such as innovation milieu may heighten the effects of the PH on capital-intensive or high-tech PIIs. This study provides China's evidences about the co-existence of the PHH and the PH, and can advance our understanding of the restructuring process and mechanism of PIIs at finer geographical scales.},

  abstract = {Income mobility is an important issue that can balance equity and efficiency in economic development. Specifically, income mobility is one of the most effective metrics for addressing the problem of income inequality and also a useful criterion for judging the vitality of economic development. Given its increasing regional income inequality, the study of regional income mobility is particularly significant for China. Considering the scaledependent nature of income distribution, this article explores regional income mobility at multiple scales, including provincial, economic region and national from 1985 to 2015 under an analytical framework integrating a global indicator of mobility association (GIMA) and a family of local indicators of mobility association (LIMAs). The results can be used to fairly and comprehensively evaluate the levels of multiscale regional income mobility by combining corresponding regional economic policies. Based on the eight economic zones, intraregional concordance and interregional mobility are found to be the main characteristics of income mobility in the past few decades in China. This article concludes that policies aiming to increase income mobility in China should accelerate regional economic integration and develop leading cities to drive the economic development of the province.},

This paper analyzes the changing geography of M\&As and its influencing factors in China during the period of 2002{\textendash}2016. It shows a significant ``core-periphery'' spatial pattern or network structure, in which a core group of major metropolises and developed provinces, led by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, dominates China's M\&As market and inter-regional networks, marginalizing the other regions. The descriptive and modelling results indicate that spatial proximity and corporate preferences for localized assets can shape this geography of China's domestic M\&As. The findings confirm that the ``home bias'' does exist in China's M\&As partnering. Meanwhile, the key drivers of China's domestic acquirers are their desire to access and internalize localized assets, especially in the emerging market, new technology, and policy advantages. This study enriches the existing knowledge about the determinants of inter-regional M\&As in emerging economies (e.g., China), where the influences of regional disparities in the institutional setting, industrial structure, as well as economic marketization and financialization are more significant.},

The results indicated a general growth trend in overall economic development, with substantial fluctuations in absolute differences and a significant reduction in relative differences. The economic development appeared to be balanced both within and between cities. Spatially, the study revealed an increasing agglomeration effect, evident polarization in economic levels, and a distinct core{\textendash}periphery structure, with central cities in the Greater Bay Area exerting a growing influence on their peripheries. Nevertheless, the peripheral cities, despite their economic strides, necessitate augmented policy interventions and capital influx to bridge regional chasms.

  abstract = {This study explores the spatial inequality of job accessibility in urban China, focusing on geographical skills mismatch in Shanghai. Our results suggest that geographical skills mismatch should be a critical concern in measuring job accessibility because the urban villages create residential sites for low-skill workers in central Shanghai. Based on the job accessibility index considering geographical skills mismatch, the floating population has high job accessibility in the periphery of the central urban area because there are affordable housing prices. The spatial distribution of the registered population's job accessibility still follows the core-periphery pattern. The spatial mismatch between the job centers for floating and registered populations might enlarge the segregation between them. The path analysis reveals that the housing/rent market, urban structure, and education attainment collectively shape job accessibility through residential segregation. Furthermore, path analysis manifests that high-skill people, mainly living in the central urban area, have significantly higher job accessibility. The polycentric development fails to create self-contained job centers for low-skill people. Future policies should pay attention to connecting the low-skill workers and their job markets through public rental housing or improving the public transit system.},

This paper investigates the jobs-housing imbalance problem in Shanghai at the subdistrict-level (census-level) and reaches the following conclusions. First, the jobs-housing imbalance shows a ring pattern and is evident mainly in the suburban areas and periphery of the Shanghai metropolitan area because job opportunities are highly concentrated while residential areas are sprawling. Second, structural factors such as high housing prices and sprawling development significantly contribute to the jobs-housing imbalance. Third, regional planning policies such as development zones contribute to jobs-housing imbalance due to the specialized industrial structure and limited availability of housing. However, geographically weighted regression reveals the development zones in the traditional Pudong district are exceptional insofar as government policy has created spatial heterogeneity there. In addition, the multilevel model used in this study suggests regions with jobs-housing imbalance usually have well-connected streets, and this represents the local government's efforts to reduce excessive commuting times created by jobs-housing imbalance.},

In this study, we obtained dynamic traffic conditions and realistic EMS demand from online map services and historical emergency calls-out data, and then developed three location-based spatio-temporal EMS accessibility measurements. The empirical results demonstrate that the three different spatio-temporal EMS accessibility have a complex relationship, and are beneficial for measuring the EMS spatio-temporal disparity in different scenarios with distinct competitive effects. Ultimately, we emphasized four original EMS accessibility patterns, which helped us uncover significantly well-served or underserved areas. This study contributes to optimize the layout of EMS resources by understanding the regularity of EMS spatio-temporal disparity.},

The findings show that the exposure to opportunities for diverse social contact measured by MPA data is generally higher than what is implied by residential census data, especially in areas of high residential segregation in the city. Further, measures using MPA data reveal more spatiotemporal heterogeneity of exposure than that implied by the residential context.},

However, these powerful methods often fail to perform pattern analysis and knowledge mining with spatial vector data because in most cases, such data are not underlying grid-like or array structures but can only be modeled as graph structures. The present study introduces a novel graph convolution by converting it from the vertex domain into a point-wise product in the Fourier domain using the graph Fourier transform and convolution theorem. In addition, the graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) architecture is proposed to analyze graph-structured spatial vector data. The focus of this study is the classical task of building pattern classification, which remains limited by the use of design rules and manually extracted features for specific patterns. The spatial vector data representing grouped buildings are modeled as graphs, and indices for the characteristics of individual buildings are investigated to collect the input variables. The pattern features of these graphs are directly extracted by training labeled data. Experiments confirmed that the GCNN produces satisfactory results in terms of identifying regular and irregular patterns, and thus achieves a significant improvement over existing methods. In summary, the GCNN has considerable potential for the analysis of graph-structured spatial vector data as well as scope for further improvement.},

  abstract = {Immersive virtual- and augmented-reality headsets can overlay a flat image against any surface or hang virtual objects in the space around the user. The technology is rapidly improving and may, in the long term, replace traditional flat panel displays in many situations. When displays are no longer intrinsically flat, how should we use the space around the user for abstract data visualisation? In this paper, we ask this question with respect to origin-destination flow data in a global geographic context. We report on the findings of three studies exploring different spatial encodings for flow maps. The first experiment focuses on different 2D and 3D encodings for flows on flat maps. We find that participants are significantly more accurate with raised flow paths whose height is proportional to flow distance but fastest with traditional straight line 2D flows. In our second and third experiment we compared flat maps, 3D globes and a novel interactive design we call MapsLink, involving a pair of linked flat maps. We find that participants took significantly more time with MapsLink than other flow maps while the 3D globe with raised flows was the fastest, most accurate, and most preferred method. Our work suggests that careful use of the third spatial dimension can resolve visual clutter in complex flow maps.},

  abstract = {Effectively predicting and mitigating urban heat island (UHI) through regulation of urban landscape patterns remains a global challenge. This paper introduces a new framework for predicting land surface temperatures (LST). We introduce a heatscape index (SCSS) to establish a relationship between landscape patterns and LST within spatial grids. Furthermore, the framework employs an urban CA model, equipped with a sophisticated patch generation engine, to forecast urban landscapes under multiple scenarios. LST under these scenarios is then calculated based on the established regression relationship. Application of the framework in Wuhan yields valuable insights: (1) The regression coefficient (R2~=~0.85) between SCSS and LST indicates that changes in SCSS can well explain the spatial heterogeneity in LST, especially in areas with evident UHI effects. (2) The simulated and retrieved LST for 2015 shows high spatial consistency, achieving an R2 value of 0.81, indicating the model's credibility. (3) Scenario simulations demonstrate that rapid and compact urban land expansion would exacerbate the UHI effect, leading to extreme high-temperature areas expanding towards suburban regions and significant temperature increases in urban fringe areas. The proposed framework provides powerful tools for policymakers and urban planners to mitigate the UHI effect and enhance urban sustainability.},

The Markov chain model of the norm profile is learned from historic data of the system's normal behavior. The observed behavior of the system is analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov chain model of the norm profile supports the observed behavior. A low probability of support indicates an anomalous behavior that may result from intrusive activities. The technique was implemented and tested on the audit data of a Sun Solaris system. The testing results showed that the technique clearly distinguished intrusive activities from normal activities in the testing data.},

In this paper, we propose to forecast the CS utilization rates by considering key explanatory variables such as historical utilization rates, traffic flows, demographic properties, the number of EV registrations, and points of interest. Three machine learning models, namely random forest, feed-forward neural network, and long shortterm memory (LSTM) are adopted for the forecasting task. The proposed algorithms are validated using the real-world utilization data collected from around 130 CSs in Contra Costa County, California. The numerical study results show that the LSTM model achieves the best prediction performance. The lagged CS utilization rates and traffic flows are the two most influential features. More interestingly, the traffic flow plays a more important role in predicting the utilization rates of DC Fast CSs than that of the level 1 (L1) and level 2 (L2) CSs.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and excessive fuel consumption have become a pressing issue nowadays. Particularly, CO2 emissions from transportation account for approximately one-quarter of global emissions since 2016. Electric vehicle (EV) is considered an appealing option to address the aforementioned concerns. However, with the growing EV market, issues such as insufficient charging infrastructure to support such ever-increasing demand emerge as well. Effectively forecasting the commercial EV charging demand ensures the reliability and robustness of grid utility in the short term and helps with investment planning and resource allocation for charging infrastructures in the long run. To this end, this article presents a time-series forecasting of the monthly commercial EV charging demand using a deep learning approach-Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq). The proposed model is validated by real-world datasets from the State of Utah and the City of Los Angeles. Two prediction targets, namely one-step ahead prediction and multi-step ahead prediction, are tested. Further, the model is benchmarked and compared against other time series and machine learning models. Experiments show that both Seq2seq and long short-term memory (LSTM) generate satisfactory prediction performance for one-step prediction. However, when performing the multi-step prediction, Seq2Seq significantly outperforms other models in terms of various performance metrics, indicating the model's strong capability for sequential data predictions.},

  abstract = {Snowplow trucks serve a crucial role in winter maintenance activities by removing, loading, and disposing of snow. A performance-monitoring and analysis process can assist transportation agencies in effectively managing snowplow trucks and maintaining the normal functioning of roadways. Previous literature suggests that most snowplow truck performance analysis is done through life-cycle cost assessment at the macro level to determine the optimal life cycle for the entire truck fleet. However, this can lead to a waste of resources and may incur bias due to ignorance of performance variations resulting from endogenous and exogenous features. More important, such analysis fails to identify the factors that contribute to performance deterioration. With the proliferation of operational data on snowplow operations, these concerns can be addressed through predictive machine-learning (ML) techniques in a data-driven fashion. In this study, we applied a popular ML technique, random forest (RF), to predict the performance of snowplow trucks, which was quantified via the rank of major repair times. Another ML technique, linear support vector machine (SVM), was also applied for benchmarking and comparison. Using the snowplow truck fleet managed by the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT), both models were implemented and it was demonstrated that RF outperforms linear SVM with regard to prediction accuracy. Further, a feature importance analysis from the RF model can help transportation agencies to improve truck replacement strategies by identifying crucial performance factors. Lastly, a sample application of the developed prediction model using RF suggests the threshold of work intensity for preventing the rapid deterioration of truck performance in various working environments. Compared with the life-cycle cost analyses used in previous studies, the prediction model proposed here can help transportation agencies to better prioritize fleet replacement.

  abstract = {A regionalization system delineates the geographical landscape into spatially contiguous, homogeneous units for landscape ecology research and applications. In this study, we investigated a quantitative approach for developing a regionalization system using constrained clustering algorithms. Unlike conventional clustering, constrained clustering uses domain constraints to help guide the clustering process towards finding a desirable solution. For region delineation, the adjacency relationship between neighboring spatial units can be provided as constraints to ensure that the resulting regions are geographically connected. However, using a large-scale terrestrial ecology data set as our case study, we showed that incorporating such constraints into existing constrained clustering algorithms is not that straightforward. First, the algorithms must carefully balance the trade-off between spatial contiguity and landscape homogeneity of the regions. Second, the effectiveness of the algorithms strongly depends on how the spatial constraints are represented and incorporated into the clustering framework. In this paper, we introduced a truncated exponential kernel to represent spatial contiguity constraints for region delineation using constrained spectral clustering. We also showed that a Hadamard product approach that combines the kernel with landscape feature similarity matrix can produce regions that are more spatially contiguous compared to other baseline algorithms.},

  abstract = {Mismatching sets of boundaries present a persistent problem in spatial analysis for many different applications. Dasymetric mapping techniques can be employed to estimate population characteristics of small areas that do not correspond to census enumeration boundaries. Several types of ancillary data have been used in dasymetric mapping but performance is often limited by their relatively coarse resolution and moderate correspondence to actual population counts. The current research examines the performance of using high resolution ancillary data in the form of individual address point datasets which represent the locations of all addressable units within a jurisdiction. The performance of address points was compared with several other techniques, including areal weighting, land cover, imperviousness, road density and nighttime lights. Datasets from 16 counties in Ohio were used in the analysis, reflecting a range of different population densities. For each technique the ancillary data sources were employed to estimate census block group population counts using census tracts as source zones, and the results were compared with the known block group population counts. Results indicate that address points perform significantly better compared with other types of ancillary data. The overall error for all block groups (n = 683) using address points is 4.9\% compared with 10.8\% for imperviousness, 11.6\% for land cover, 13.3\% for road density, 18.6\% for nighttime lights and 21.2\% for areal weighting. Using only residential address points rather than all types of locations further reduces this error to 4.2\%. Analysis of the spatial patterns in the relative performance of the various techniques revealed that address points perform particularly well in low density rural areas, which typically present challenges for traditional dasymetric mapping techniques using land cover datasets. These results provide very strong support for the use of address points for small area population estimates. Current developments in the growing availability of address point datasets and the implications for spatial demographic analyses are discussed.},

The approach proposed in this paper firstly classifies the image to find road network regions, and then morphological trivial opening is adopted to avoid noise including objects that have similar spectral characteristics as road surfaces. The developed method has been tested on high resolution simulation images and aerial photos. The result shows that mathematical morphology provides an effective tool for automated road network detection.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of spatial patterns of daily precipitation are critically important for numerous hydrologic applications. However, the estimation of daily precipitation is still challenging, especially in regions with sparse observation networks and complex terrain. Although satellite precipitation products can offer continuous pre\- cipitation fields on a daily scale, the data contain large bias and coarse spatial resolution, which limit the application of these products in local studies. Here, we developed a new spatially varying coefficient downscaling approach to yield a daily precipitation field with high-resolution and high-accuracy in a high mountainous watershed. First, the random effect eigenvector spatial filtering (RESF) model was introduced and improved by considering the nonlinear term; second, the residuals were corrected by applying the simple inverse distance weighted (IDW) method. Using the proposed method, named RESF-IDW, the Global Satellite Mapping of Pre\- cipitation (GSMaP) was downscaled from 0.1{$\smwhtcircle$} to 0.01{$\smwhtcircle$} by integrating reanalyzed atmospheric data and envi\- ronmental variables as auxiliary information. The performance of RESF-IDW was evaluated and compared with the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method and the original GSMaP precipitation products at 20 national and automatic stations by using leave-one-out cross validation. The results show that compared to the original GSMaP products, RESF-IDW, RESF, GWR-IDW, and GWR exhibited improvements in their mean values of correlation coefficient (CC) by 24.5\%, 17.9\%, 12.0\%, and 3.2\%, respectively. Additionally, their mean values of mean absolute error (MAE) improved by 31.2\%, 14.9\%, 18.7\%, and 2.4\%, respectively, while their mean values of root mean square error (RMSE) improved by 24.1\%, 18.5\%, 9.6\%, and 3.8\%, respectively. The RESFIDW model can be used to correctly improve the original GSMaP product under different precipitation intensities, with critical success index (CSI) improvements of 38.81\%, 43.14\% and 44.58\% for low, medium and high precipitation intensities, respectively. The use of residual correction enhances the spatial accuracy (MAE de\- creases by 19.43\% on average) and the precipitation detection capability (CSI increases by 12.09\% on average) of the RESF estimations. Based on the error metrics, the RESF-IDW model can be used to generate improved precipitation estimates on a daily scale and has a good capability for precipitation detection over different in\- tensities. The proposed method in this study provides a promising way to generate accurate daily precipitation fields with high spatial resolution over data sparse and high mountain regions.},

  abstract = {Sustainable development of the transport system has been the consensus around the world for the past decades. Encouraged by the urgent need for cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels, vehicle electrification has been advancing at an unprecedented pace. As a major component of the multimodal transportation system, public transit is at the forefront of adopting battery technology into its operation. Battery Electric Bus (BEB), with superior features such as zero-emission and reduced noise, is made ready for commercial deployment in the past several years. However, it is still a grand challenge to successfully deploy BEB system given the nature of the public transit system and the unique spatio-temporal characteristics of BEB. This research presents a bi-objective optimization model for BEB deployment to consider constraints unique to the BEB system and to address the trade-off between environmental equity for the disadvantaged population and capital investment. The model is further demonstrated using the transit system operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) to offer insights on the benefits gained as a result of BEB deployment. Optimal deployment plans under different budgets are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the model. The trade-offs in each of the plans are further discussed and compared. This research set the foundation for transit agencies to develop optimal deployment strategies for BEB systems when multiple goals need to be considered, allowing planners and decision-makers to create a transportation ecosystem that better serves livable and sustainable communities.

This study explores how green infrastructure influences the urban heat island effects experienced by communities across the socio-economic strata found in Belfast. To avoid scale effects and obtain accurate results, we devise multiple and scale-composite greenness metrics to assess the distribution of green infrastructure based on each residential unit. The results indicate that despite widespread recognition that green infrastructure significantly contributes to the mitigation of heat island intensity, socio-economically deprived communities are exposed to greater urban heat. Further examinations identified the close correlations between green infrastructure distribution and socio-economic factors, which relate to two major spatial patterns: that the suburbs are better catered for than the inner city, and that south and east Belfast are better than west and north. Moreover, our findings identified a tendency that communities with higher proportions of female- and ageing- populations have greater greenness and are less exposed to heat, which suggests the distributional and environmental injustice in GI provision and related heat adaptation are driven by the underlying socio-economic dynamics and the vulnerable groups may change based on local context. Overall, we found that there is a need to incorporate and prioritise different types of green infrastructure in plans for heat adaptation and to integrate green infrastructure development with environmental justice in areas that suffer socio-ecological deprivation in mitigating urban heat island effects.},

Design: The sample for this ecologic study comprised 188 census tracts from the City of Austin, Texas and 263 tracts from the City of San Antonio, Texas. Data pertaining to neighbourhood social structure, alcohol density and violent crime were collected from archival sources, and analysed using bivariate, multivariate and geospatial analyses. Results: Using ordinary least squares analysis, the neighbourhood sociostructural covariates explained close to 59\% of the variability in violent crime rates in Austin and close to 39\% in San Antonio. Adding alcohol outlet density in the target and adjacent census tracts improved the explanatory power of both models. Alcohol outlet density in the target census tract remained a significant predictor of violent crime rates in both cities when the effects of autocorrelated error were controlled for. In Austin, the effects of alcohol outlet density in the adjacent census tracts also remained significant. The final model explains 71\% of the variance in violent crime in Austin and 56\% in San Antonio. Conclusions: The findings show a clear association between alcohol outlet density and violence, and suggest that the issues of alcohol availability and access are fundamental to the prevention of alcohol-related problems within communities. {\textcopyright} Medical Council on Alcohol 2004; all rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Temporal analysis of small-area demographic data commonly relies on areal interpolation methods to create temporally consistent and compatible areal units. In this study, cadastral (parcel) data are used to identify residential land and to dasymetrically refine census tracts, with the goal of achieving more accurate small-area estimates. The built date recorded for residential parcel units is used to create residential land layers for two different time points used in the areal interpolation. Three different areal interpolation methods are employed with and without dasymetric refinement, including areal weighting (AW), target density weighting (TDW) and pycnophylactic modeling (PM). The methods interpolate tract-level population counts in Hennepin County, Minnesota, in 2000 into census tract boundaries from the year 2010. The mean absolute error, median absolute error, root mean square error and the 90th percentile of absolute error are calculated for each of the methods, and spatial variation in the interpolations are displayed in maps. Parcel-based refinements are also compared with refinements using the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD).},

  abstract = {The gap between wealthy and disadvantaged neighbourhoods seems to be increasing in many contemporary Western cities. Most studies of neighbourhood change focus on specific case-studies of neighbourhood downgrading or gentrification. Studies investigating socio-spatial polarisation in larger urban areas often compare neighbourhoods at two points in time, neglecting the underlying dynamic character of neighbourhoods. In the current literature, the question if neighbourhoods with similar characteristics experience similar changes over time remains unanswered. As a result, it is unclear why some neighbourhoods appear to be more prone to change than others. In this paper, we propose a dual approach for analysing neighbourhood change. We argue that researchers should both adopt a long-term perspective (20{\textendash}40~years), because significant changes are only visible after longer periods of time, and focus on more detailed neighbourhood trajectories to understand how neighbourhood change is interrelated with context. Focussing on Dutch neighbourhoods over the period 1971{\textendash}2013, we analyse the role of physical characteristics on low-income neighbourhood trajectories using an innovative visualisation technique. A tree-structured discrepancy analysis allows for the visualisation of complete neighbourhood pathways, enabling the analysis of complex, contextualised patterns of change. We find that the original quality of neighbourhoods and dwellings seems to be an important predictor for future neighbourhood trajectories, indicating a high level of path-dependency.},
