## Outline

- Accounts
- Introduction to Jupyter Hub

## Objective
To introduce students to JupyterLab and help them become comformatible with its
interface for the semester-long course.



## Introduction
This course is designed to equip students with the skills and practices to fully
engage with, and contribute to, these developments. It relies on open source
software which is essential since it provides access to free, high-quality,
cross-platform tools. At the same time, free availability does not necessarily
translate into skill acquisition, and a key goal of this course is to flatten
the learning curve for students discovering these new tools and practices.



The course is structured as a blending of a lecture and studio.  In the lecture
component of the course, the literature surrounding the course project will be
discussed and evaluated to shape the empirical project which will form the key
focus of the second half of the semester.  In the studio component of the
course, students will be exposed to open source tools (software), technologies
(github, CI/CD), and practices (collaborative development) in GIS projects.


## Accounts

If you are in SH 324, you can use an account on the lab machines to get  to a
browser. Today we will distribute your accounts.

## Accessing the Course JupyterHub

### On-campus access

If you are on campus, use a browser to go to:
[http://130.191.118.182](http://130.191.118.182)


### Off-campus access

Private Network (VPN). Follow these [instructions](https://security.sdsu.edu/services/virtual-private-network) for setting up the vpn on your private computer.


Either way (on- or off-campus) once you connect you should be greated with the
